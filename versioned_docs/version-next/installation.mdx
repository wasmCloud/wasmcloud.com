# Install wasmCloud

Install the parts of the [wasmCloud platform](./overview/index.mdx) that you need depending on what you want to accomplish:

* If you want to **develop and publish Wasm applications**, [install the Wasm Shell (`wash`) CLI](#install-wash).  
* If you want to **run Wasm workloads on Kubernetes**, [install wasmCloud on Kubernetes](#install-wasmcloud-on-kubernetes).

## Install `wash`

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
  <TabItem value="macoslinux" label="macOS and Linux" default>

In your terminal, run the installation script to download and install the latest version of `wash` (**`2.0.0-rc.7`**):

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmcloud/wash/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

On a successful installation, the script will return:

```shell
[INFO] Next steps:
  1. Add /path/to to your PATH if not already included
  2. Run 'wash --help' to see available commands
  3. Run 'wash doctor' to verify your environment
  4. Run 'wash new' to create your first WebAssembly component
```

Add `wash` to your PATH with the filepath listed in Step 1, replacing `/path/to` with your local filepath:

```shell
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wash"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

In PowerShell, run the installation script to download and install the latest version of `wash`:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmcloud/wash/refs/heads/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

```powershell
Next steps:
  1. Add /path/to to your PATH if not already included
  2. Run 'wash --help' to see available commands
  3. Run 'wash doctor' to verify your environment
  4. Run 'wash new' to create your first WebAssembly component
```

To add `wash` to your PATH by updating your PowerShell profile, add the filepath for `wash` returned above to your profile, replacing `/path/to` with your local filepath:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```
```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\path\to\wash"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="source" label="Source">

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash.git
cd wash
cargo install --path .
```

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash/releases).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that `wash` is properly installed and check your version for **`2.0.0-rc.7`** with:

```bash
wash -V
```

Now that `wash` is installed, the next step is to [build and publish a Wasm application](./wash/developer-guide/build-and-publish.mdx).

## Install wasmCloud on Kubernetes

Installation requires the following tools:

- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs) v3.8.0+

You'll also need a Kubernetes environment. We recommend [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) for the best local Kubernetes experience.

### Local Kubernetes environment

You can use the one-liner below to start a `kind` cluster with a configuration from the [`wasmcloud/wash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/kind-config.yaml) repository. 

```shell
curl -fLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/kind-config.yaml && kind create cluster --config=kind-config.yaml && rm kind-config.yaml
```

### Install the wasmCloud operator

Use Helm to install the wasmCloud operator from an OCI chart image, using the [values for local installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/charts/runtime-operator/values.local.yaml):

```shell
helm install wasmcloud --version v2-canary oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/runtime-operator -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/charts/runtime-operator/values.local.yaml
```

Verify the deployment:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud -n default
```

Once all pods are running, you're ready to deploy a Wasm workload.

### Deploy a Wasm workload

You can deploy a "Hello world" Wasm workload from a [wasmCloud-hosted manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/examples/http-hello-world/manifests/workloaddeployment.yaml) with this `kubectl` command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wash/refs/heads/main/examples/http-hello-world/manifests/workloaddeployment.yaml
```

Use `curl` to invoke the Wasm workload with an HTTP request:

```shell
curl localhost -i
```
```text
Hello from wasmCloud!
```

For more information on each of these steps, see [Kubernetes Operator](./kubernetes-operator/index.mdx).

## Clean up

Delete the workload deployment:

```shell
kubectl delete workloaddeployment hello-world
```

Uninstall wasmCloud:

```shell
helm uninstall wasmcloud
```

Delete the local Kubernetes environment:

```shell
kind delete cluster
```

## Next steps

* Read the [Overview](./overview/index.mdx) for an explanation of core concepts in wasmCloud.
* Explore the [`wash/examples` directory](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/examples) for more advanced Wasm component examples.
* Check out the [Developer Guide](./wash/developer-guide/index.mdx) for information on building Wasm components.
