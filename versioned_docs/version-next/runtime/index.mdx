# Runtime

### wasmCloud's runtime (`wash-runtime`) is a simple, flexible runtime environment for WebAssembly workloads.

[`wash-runtime`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/crates/wash-runtime) is a Rust crate that includes Wasmtime as the underlying runtime engine, as well as the wasmCloud host, which serves as a runtime environment for WebAssembly components. A plugin system allows for extension of the host with new and custom capabilities.

The runtime provides easy-to-use abstractions over the low-level [Wasmtime API](https://wasmtime.dev/), as well as wasmCloud-specific APIs for managing workloads, handling NATS subscriptions, managing and utilizing host plugins, and more.

For a step-by-step guide to embedding the runtime, see [Building Custom Hosts](./building-custom-hosts.mdx). To extend a host with new capabilities, see [Creating Host Plugins](./creating-host-plugins.mdx).

## Architecture

The runtime provides three primary abstractions:

1. **Engine**: Wasmtime configuration and component compilation
2. **Host**: Runtime environment with plugin management
3. **Workload**: High-level API for managing component lifecycles

## WASI Interface Support

The crate includes two sets of built-in plugins, one working in-memory for development with `wash dev`, and the other backed by NATS for production deployment. Some plugins can be enabled or disabled via Cargo feature flags. Both sets of plugins support the following interfaces:

- `wasi:http`
- `wasi:keyvalue`
- `wasi:blobstore`
- `wasi:config`
- `wasi:logging`
- `wasi:filesystem`
- `wasmcloud:messaging`

Hosts can be extended with additional host plugins at build-time.

## Usage

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::collections::HashMap;

use wash_runtime::{
    engine::Engine,
    host::{HostBuilder, HostApi},
    plugin::wasi_http::HttpServer,
    plugin::wasi_config::RuntimeConfig,
    types::{WorkloadStartRequest, Workload},
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create a Wasmtime engine
    let engine = Engine::builder().build()?;

    // Configure plugins
    let http_plugin = HttpServer::new("127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?);
    let config_plugin = RuntimeConfig::default();

    // Build and start the host
    let host = HostBuilder::new()
        .with_engine(engine)
        .with_plugin(Arc::new(http_plugin))?
        .with_plugin(Arc::new(config_plugin))?
        .build()?;

    let host = host.start().await?;

    // Start a workload
    let req = WorkloadStartRequest {
        workload: Workload {
            namespace: "test".to_string(),
            name: "test-workload".to_string(),
            annotations: HashMap::new(),
            service: None,
            components: vec![],
            host_interfaces: vec![],
            volumes: vec![],
        },
    };

    host.workload_start(req).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## `cargo` Features

The crate supports the following `cargo` features:

- `wasi-http` (default): HTTP client and server support via `wasmtime-wasi-http`
- `wasi-config` (default): Runtime configuration interface
- `wasi-logging` (default): Logging interface
- `wasi-blobstore` (default): Blob storage interface
- `wasi-keyvalue` (default): Key-value storage interface
- `oci`: OCI registry integration for pulling components
