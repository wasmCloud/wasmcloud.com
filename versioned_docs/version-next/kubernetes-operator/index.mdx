# Kubernetes Operator

### The `runtime-operator` makes it easy to run wasmCloud and WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes.

:::warning[Under construction]
This section is under active development&mdash;please check back soon for a more complete reference.
:::

The [`runtime-operator`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/runtime-operator) uses the [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](./crds.mdx) to run wasmCloud on Kubernetes&mdash;utilizing Kubernetes as a scheduler for wasmCloud infrastructure and workloads.

## Components and cloud native standards

wasmCloud is designed to conform to cloud native standards, making it simple to use existing tooling.

- **Custom resources**: wasmCloud primitives are defined as [custom resources](./crds.mdx) aligned to standard Kubernetes patterns. If you know how an ordinary Kubernetes `Deployment` works, a wasmCloud `WorkloadDeployment` will be easy to understand.
- **Argo CD**: Smoothly integrate Argo CD for GitOps workflows.
- **Pull from OCI registries**: wasmCloud pulls Wasm components packaged as Open Container Initiative (OCI) images&mdash;so it's simple to store application components and providers in your existing private registries.

## Next steps

* The [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](./crds.mdx) section explains the custom resources used by wasmCloud.
* The [API reference](./api-reference.md) provides a complete API specification.
