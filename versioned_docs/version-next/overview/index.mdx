**wasmCloud** is a suite of tooling that enables you to write code in your language of choice, compile code into portable, sandboxed WebAssembly (Wasm) components, and run those components anywhere&mdash;from your laptop to the edge to the cloud.

## Who uses wasmCloud?

The wasmCloud ecosystem includes tools for platform engineers, developers, and edge engineers who build and run Wasm components:

* **Developers** use the [Wasm Shell (`wash`) CLI](../wash/get-started.mdx) to build Wasm components in languages such as Go, JavaScript (TypeScript), and Rust, and publish those components to OCI registries.
* **Platform engineers** use standard cloud-native tooling like `kubectl` to build platforms for Wasm applications, leveraging a Kubernetes operator and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that make it easy to run wasmCloud on Kubernetes. 
* **Edge engineers** use the `wasmcloud` binary to run Wasm applications at the edge.

In wasmCloud, workloads are comprised of **components** that make and respond to calls over **interfaces**:

* [Components](./components.mdx) are portable, interoperable WebAssembly binaries that implement stateless logic.
* [Interfaces](./interfaces.mdx)

Workloads run on **hosts** that can be extended with **extensions**:

* [Hosts](./hosts.mdx) 
* [Extensions](./extensions.mdx)

**Transport** and **scheduling**:
