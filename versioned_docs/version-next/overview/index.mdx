### wasmCloud is a cloud native platform for running WebAssembly workloads across any cloud, Kubernetes, datacenter, or edge.

WebAssembly (Wasm) components are a lightweight, secure-by-default unit of compute that is well-suited to sensitive workloads and greenfield applications. Teams can use wasmCloud to deploy these applications in lightweight, universal sandboxes and run them efficiently on existing cloud native infrastructure.

## The platform

The wasmCloud platform consists of three primary parts:

* [Wasm Shell (`wash`) CLI](../wash/index.mdx): A development tool for building and publishing WebAssembly components with languages including Go, TypeScript, Rust, and more. 
* [Runtime (`wash-runtime`)](../runtime/index.mdx): An easy-to-use runtime and workload API for executing WebAssembly components, with built-in support for WASI interfaces. 
* [Kubernetes Operator (`runtime-operator`)](../kubernetes-operator/index.mdx): An operations tool that runs wasmCloud infrastructure on Kubernetes. 

Component developers use the [Wasm Shell (`wash`) CLI](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/) to develop and publish components, and the [wasmCloud operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/runtime-operator) integrates wasmCloud with Kubernetes.

## The architecture

In most deployments, wasmCloud runs on Kubernetes, where the wasmCloud operator communicates over [NATS transport](./transport.mdx) to manage hosts and workloads, mediating between hosts and the Kubernetes API server.

*Note: The wasmCloud operator can run with a standalone Kubernetes API server for edge use-cases, and the wasmCloud runtime can run with alternative schedulers.*

**Workloads** are comprised of **Wasm components** that make and respond to calls over **interfaces**:

* [Components](./workloads.mdx) are portable, interoperable WebAssembly binaries that implement stateless logic.
* [Interfaces](./interfaces.mdx) are contracts that define the relationships between entities.

Workloads run on **hosts** that can be extended with **host plugins**:

* [Hosts](./hosts/index.mdx) are runtime environments for WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads.
* [Plugins](./hosts/plugins.mdx) extend hosts with additional capabilities.
