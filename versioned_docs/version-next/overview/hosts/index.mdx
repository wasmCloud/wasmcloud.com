### The wasmCloud host is a runtime environment for WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads. 

WebAssembly components require a runtime to execute. The wasmCloud host provides a wrapper around [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), a fast, secure, and standards-compliant WebAssembly runtime that supports the [Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model).

Users can build [**host plugins**](./plugins.mdx) to customize wasmCloud hosts with extended capabilities using the [runtime library](../../runtime/index.mdx).

### Hosts as commodity

A core design principle of wasmCloud is that the health of applications should not be dependent on any particular host. Hosts are designed to be operated in **host groups**, such that they are interchangeable and should be able to start and stop without causing downtime. 

While it is possible to run a single host, it's also possible for workloads to be distributed across many hosts, and for those hosts to dynamically scale in response to changing demand.

{/* #### Logs

Hosts emit unstructured (text) or structured (JSON) logs. The log level and format can be configured for each host [at start time](/docs/reference/host-config). 

### The control interface

The API for managing hosts, their inventories (components and providers), and host/lattice metadata is a [set of NATS subscriptions](/docs/hosts/lattice-protocols/control-interface). A separate server is not needed to manage hosts and the lattice. Instead, each host within a lattice subscribes to NATS subjects corresponding to its own responsibilities, as well as lattice-wide subjects.

### Interoperable events

:::warning[Planned changes to events]
The [**wasmCloud Q3 2025 Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) sets out plans for changes to the events implementation in the next major release of wasmCloud. In the new approach, events are handled at the operator layer, leveraging OpenTelemetry and discontinuing usage of CloudEvents. For more information, see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) and [Issue #4641: “Reduce host responsibility and API surface.”](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/4641)
:::

Hosts will emit [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) during normal operation, as well as in response to errors. These [events](/docs/reference/cloud-event-list) reflect coarse-grained state changes for a lattice. This event log is useful for monitoring and observability, and is used internally by [wadm](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/) to track whether applications have been successfully deployed. */}
