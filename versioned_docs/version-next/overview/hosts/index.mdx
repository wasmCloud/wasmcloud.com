### The wasmCloud host is a runtime environment for WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads. 

WebAssembly components require a runtime to execute. The wasmCloud host provides a wrapper around [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), a fast, secure, and standards-compliant WebAssembly runtime that supports the [Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model).

Users can build [**host plugins**](./plugins.mdx) to customize wasmCloud hosts with extended capabilities using the [runtime library](../../runtime/index.mdx).

## Hosts as commodity

A core design principle of wasmCloud is that the health of applications should not be dependent on any particular host. Hosts are designed to be operated in **host groups**, such that they are interchangeable and should be able to start and stop without causing downtime. 

While it is possible to run a single host, it's also possible for workloads to be distributed across many hosts, and for those hosts to dynamically scale in response to changing demand.

## Usage

The wasmCloud host is designed for flexibility and may be used in a variety of ways:

- **Edge computing**: Run lightweight hosts on edge devices (IoT gateways, retail kiosks, factory equipment) to process data locally with minimal latency.
- **Multi-cloud deployments**: Deploy hosts across AWS, Azure, and GCP to run the same workloads without vendor-specific modifications.
- **Kubernetes clusters**: Run hosts as pods in Kubernetes, managed by the [wasmCloud operator](../../kubernetes-operator/index.mdx) for automatic scaling and orchestration.
- **Development environments**: Run a local host on your laptop for testing and debugging before deploying to production.
