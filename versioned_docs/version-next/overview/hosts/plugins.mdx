### Host plugins extend hosts with additional capabilities.

Plugins provide capabilities at the host level, extending a wasmCloud host with specific implementations of [interfaces](../interfaces.mdx). Each plugin implements a **WIT world**—a collection of imports and exports that are directly linked to workloads at runtime.

Plugins allow you to customize how your host handles common operations like HTTP requests, key-value storage, configuration, and logging. You can use the built-in plugins provided by `wash-runtime`, or implement custom plugins for specialized requirements.

## Built-in plugins

The [`wash-runtime`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/crates/wash-runtime) crate includes built-in plugins for common WASI interfaces. These plugins come in two variants: in-memory implementations for local development (used by `wash dev`), and NATS-backed implementations for production deployments.

| Plugin | Interface | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **HTTP** | `wasi:http` | HTTP client and server capabilities |
| **Key-Value** | `wasi:keyvalue` | Key-value storage operations |
| **Blobstore** | `wasi:blobstore` | Blob/object storage operations |
| **Config** | `wasi:config` | Runtime configuration access |
| **Logging** | `wasi:logging` | Structured logging output |
| **Filesystem** | `wasi:filesystem` | File system access within workload boundaries |
| **Messaging** | `wasmcloud:messaging` | Message passing and pub/sub communication |

Filesystem and Messaging are always available. The remaining plugins can be enabled or disabled via Cargo feature flags when building your host:

```toml
[dependencies]
wash-runtime = { version = "0.1", features = ["wasi-http", "wasi-keyvalue", "wasi-config"] }
```

## Using plugins

Plugins are registered with the host using the `HostBuilder` API. The following example demonstrates how to configure a host with HTTP and configuration plugins:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::collections::HashMap;

use wash_runtime::{
    engine::Engine,
    host::{HostBuilder, HostApi},
    plugin::wasi_http::HttpServer,
    plugin::wasi_config::RuntimeConfig,
    types::{WorkloadStartRequest, Workload},
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create a Wasmtime engine
    let engine = Engine::builder().build()?;

    // Configure plugins
    let http_plugin = HttpServer::new("127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?);
    let config_plugin = RuntimeConfig::default();

    // Build and start the host with plugins
    let host = HostBuilder::new()
        .with_engine(engine)
        .with_plugin(Arc::new(http_plugin))?
        .with_plugin(Arc::new(config_plugin))?
        .build()?;

    let host = host.start().await?;

    // Start a workload (components will have access to plugin capabilities)
    let req = WorkloadStartRequest {
        workload: Workload {
            namespace: "example".to_string(),
            name: "my-workload".to_string(),
            annotations: HashMap::new(),
            service: None,
            components: vec![],
            host_interfaces: vec![],
            volumes: vec![],
        },
    };

    host.workload_start(req).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

:::info[Default behavior]
If a handler is not provided for a particular capability, a "deny all" implementation is used. This ensures that components cannot access capabilities unless explicitly configured.

## Custom plugins

You can create custom plugins by implementing the `HostPlugin` trait. See [Creating Host Plugins](../../runtime/creating-host-plugins.mdx) for more information.

Custom plugins are useful when you need to:

- **Integrate with proprietary systems**: Connect components to internal APIs, databases, or services that don't have standard WASI interfaces.
- **Add security layers**: Implement custom authentication, authorization, or audit logging for capability access.
- **Provide specialized hardware access**: Expose GPUs or other specialized hardware to components.
