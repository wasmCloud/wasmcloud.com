Plugins provide capabilities at the host level, extending a wasmCloud host with a specific implementation of a given capability according to an interface.

Plugins are built into the host before deployment; you can find a [basic example](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/crates/wash-runtime#usage) in the `wash-runtime` repository, or see this [discussion of host plugin implementation in a wasmCloud community call](https://www.youtube.com/live/3DlUjl8gQVs?si=MbTz4MohjYDmE8fI&t=731).
