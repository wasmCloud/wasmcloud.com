**Services** are WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries that can provide persistent, stateful processes within the [workload](../../overview/workloads/index.mdx) boundary for one or more companion Wasm components.

In this section of the Developer Guide, you'll learn how to:

* Create and iterate on a service

:::info[Prerequisites]
If you haven't read the [Workload](../../overview/workloads/index.mdx) and [Service Overviews](../../overview/workloads/services.mdx) or completed the [previous section](./index.mdx) on installing `wash`, creating a project, and starting a developer loop, we recommend starting there.

## Service development

Services are developed using the `wash dev` command with special configuration.

:::warning[Under active development]
Service development support is actively evolving. Check back soon for more information.
