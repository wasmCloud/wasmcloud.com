wasmCloud runs standard [WebAssembly components](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) targeting [WASI P2](https://wasi.dev/). Any language toolchain that can produce a Wasm component with WASI P2 support can build components that run on wasmCloud.

This page provides a reference for various languages' support for compiling WebAssembly components, as well as wasmCloud ecosystem support for building and running components developed in a given language.

## Component Support

This chart summarizes the current state of language support for WebAssembly components, from languages with built-in WASI P2 targets to toolchains that are still in progress.

| Language | Toolchain | Status | WASI version |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | `cargo` + `wasm32-wasip2` target | Stable | P2 |
| **Go** | TinyGo | Stable | P2 |
| **TypeScript / JavaScript** | `jco` + `componentize-js` | Stable | P2 |
| **C# / .NET** | `componentize-dotnet` | Stable | P2 |
| **Python** | `componentize-py` | Stable | P2 |
| **C / C++** | `wasi-sdk` | In progress | P1 (P2 in progress) |
| **Ruby** | `ruby.wasm` | In progress | P2 (partial) |
| **Kotlin** | Kotlin/Wasm (native) | Planned | &mdash; |
| **Swift** | SwiftWasm | Roadmap accepted | &mdash; |
| **Java** | GraalWasm | Planned | &mdash; |

## Tier 1: Well-supported toolchains

These languages are supported by wasmCloud component project templates, `wash dev` integration, and documentation in the [Developer Guide](../index.mdx).

### Rust

Rust has first-class WebAssembly support via the `wasm32-wasip2` compiler target, which ships with the standard Rust toolchain.

- **Toolchain:** `cargo` with target `wasm32-wasip2` (install via `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`)
- **Bindings:** The [`wstd`](https://crates.io/crates/wstd) crate provides an async Rust standard library for Wasm components and WASI 0.2, hosted by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wstd). You can also use [`wit-bindgen`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) directly for lower-level control.
- **Get started:** [Developer Guide](../index.mdx?lang=rust) | [Rust Language Guide](./rust/index.mdx)

### JavaScript (TypeScript)

TypeScript components are built using the [`jco`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) toolchain (part of the Bytecode Alliance), which compiles JS/TS to Wasm components via [`componentize-js`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS).

- **Toolchain:** `jco` + `componentize-js`
- **Bindings:** `jco` generates TypeScript types from WIT files automatically
- **Get started:** [Developer Guide](../index.mdx?lang=typescript) | [TypeScript Language Guide](./typescript/index.mdx)

### Go (TinyGo)

wasmCloud uses [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) (not the standard Go compiler) for WebAssembly component support. TinyGo compiles a large subset of Go to WebAssembly with a much smaller binary footprint.

- **Toolchain:** TinyGo with `-target wasip2`
- **Bindings:** [`wit-bindgen-go`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/go-modules) generates Go bindings from WIT files. The [`go.wasmcloud.dev/component`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main/component) package provides idiomatic Go helpers (e.g. `wasihttp.HandleFunc` for `net/http`-style request handling).
- **`wash` support:** `wash new`, `wash dev`, `wash build` &mdash; requires a [`.wash/config.yaml` configuration file](../../config.mdx) and a `Makefile`
- **Get started:** [Developer Guide](../index.mdx?lang=tinygo) | [Go Language Guide](./go/index.mdx)

:::note[Why TinyGo?]
The standard Go compiler does not yet support the Wasm Component Model. TinyGo targets `wasip2` directly and produces much smaller binaries, making it the current path for Go developers building Wasm components.
:::

## Tier 2: Stable toolchains

These languages have stable Component Model toolchains that can produce components compatible with wasmCloud. You can build components manually and run them with `wash`, but there are no `wash` project templates or `wash dev` integrations yet.

### C# / .NET

[`componentize-dotnet`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-dotnet) is a Bytecode Alliance project that compiles .NET applications to Wasm components using NativeAOT.

- **Toolchain:** `componentize-dotnet` NuGet package
- **Status:** Stable; actively maintained by the Bytecode Alliance
- **Build:** Components are built with `dotnet build` and the `componentize-dotnet` MSBuild integration
- **Repository:** [bytecodealliance/componentize-dotnet](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-dotnet)

### Python

[`componentize-py`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py) is a Bytecode Alliance project that compiles Python applications to Wasm components.

- **Toolchain:** `componentize-py` CLI
- **Status:** Stable; actively maintained by the Bytecode Alliance
- **Build:** `componentize-py componentize --wit-path wit --world <world-name> -o output.wasm app.py`
- **Repository:** [bytecodealliance/componentize-py](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py)

## Tier 3: In progress or planned

These toolchains are actively working toward Component Model support. Components built with these tools may not yet be fully compatible with wasmCloud.

| Language | Toolchain | Status | More information |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C / C++** | [`wasi-sdk`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) | WASI P1 stable; P2 + Component Model support in progress | [wasi-sdk releases](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases) |
| **Ruby** | [`ruby.wasm`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm) | Component Model support in progress | [ruby.wasm repository](https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm) |
| **Kotlin** | Kotlin/Wasm | Native Wasm Component Model support planned by JetBrains | [JetBrains tracking issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-56492) |
| **Swift** | SwiftWasm | Component Model roadmap accepted | [WebAssembly vision](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/webassembly.md) |
| **Java** | [GraalWasm](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/wasm/) | WASI support planned | [GraalVM documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/wasm/) |

## Binding generators

Most languages use [`wit-bindgen`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) (or a language-specific tool built on the same foundation) to generate typed bindings from WIT interface definitions. `wit-bindgen` currently supports:

- **Rust** (`wit-bindgen-rust`)
- **Go** (`wit-bindgen-go`)
- **C** (`wit-bindgen-c`)
- **C#** (via `componentize-dotnet`)
- **Java** (`wit-bindgen-java`, early stage)

For TypeScript/JavaScript, [`jco`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) handles binding generation as part of its build pipeline.
