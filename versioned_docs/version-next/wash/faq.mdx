# Wasm Shell Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

**How can I run components built with Wasm Shell?**

You can use `wash` to create and publish WebAssembly components for any runtime or runtime environment that supports the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/), including wasmCloud, Spin, jco, wasmtime, and others.

## Differences from `wash` v0.x

**What are the differences between __Wasm Shell__ (`wash` v1.x and higher) and __wasmCloud Shell__ (`wash` v0.x and below)?**

**wasmCloud Shell**, the previous iteration of `wash`, was designed as a utility for building WebAssembly components *and* managing wasmCloud deployments. 

**Wasm Shell** (`wash` v1.x and higher) is designed to follow the Unix principle of "doing one thing and doing it well"&mdash;in this case, it is a dedicated utility for WebAssembly component development. Wasm Shell is designed to be extensible via plugins and usable across the Wasm ecosystem. 

This means that many commands and features that were available in `wash` v0.x are not included in Wasm Shell, but may be implemented via plugins. 

The table below outlines major differences in versions:

| FEATURE                                          | Wasm Shell (v1.x and higher)       | wasmCloud Shell (v0.x and below)   | Notes                                                                             |

## Troubleshooting

**I'm getting the error `failed to initialize plugin manager` when I run a command&mdash;what could be causing this?**

If you've updated `wash`, changes to WIT may be acting as a breaking change. To address the error, uninstall your plugins, then build and reinstall the plugins.

### Building with TinyGo

**Do I need to use a configuration file for TinyGo builds?**

Yes. TinyGo builds require a configuration file that is stored in a `.wash` subfolder of your project directory. This file is required in order to specify the WIT world used by the component.

If you attempt to build without a configuration file, `wash` will create a `config.yaml` file at `./.wash/config.yaml` and return this message:

```text
TinyGo builds require wit_world to be specified in the configuration. A config file has been created at ./.wash/config.yaml with a placeholder. Please update the wit_world field to match your WIT world name.
```

For instructions on configuring a TinyGo build, see [Configuration](./config.mdx).

#### Common issues with TinyGo builds

There are a number of common issues with TinyGo builds that can be difficult to interpret based on error messages:

##### Missing Function Export

```shell
error: failed to encode a component from module
Caused by:
    0: failed to decode world from module
    1: module was not valid
    2: failed to find export of interface `wasmcloud:wash/plugin@0.0.1` function `info`
`wasm-tools component new` failed: exit status 1
```
**What happened:** You didn't export a function that's required by your WIT world definition.

**What to do:** Update your Go code to export all functions required in your WIT world, or remove extraneous functions from your WIT world definition.

##### Imports Not Generated Properly

```shell
error: failed to encode a component from module
Caused by:
    0: failed to decode world from module
    1: module was not valid
    2: failed to resolve import `wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0::handle`
    3: module requires an import interface named `wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0`
`wasm-tools component new` failed: exit status 1
```
**What happened:** You don't have your imports generated properly.

**What to do:** Re-generate imports, attempt to build again, and debug imports if unsuccessful.

##### WIT Files Not Available

```shell                  
error: failed to read path for WIT [./wit]
Caused by:
    0: No such file or directory (os error 2)
`wasm-tools component embed` failed: exit status 1
```
**What happened:** Your WIT files aren't available at the specified path.

**What to do:** Ensure that your WIT files are available at the specified path.

##### Importing Unsupported Interface

```shell
failed to pre-instantiate component
Caused by:
    0: component imports instance `wasi:http/types@0.2.0`, but a matching implementation was not found in the linker
    1: instance export `fields` has the wrong type
    2: resource implementation is missing
```
**What happened:** You are importing an interface that `wash` doesn't know about.

**What to do:** If you believe `wash` should support the interface, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/issues/new).

##### Missing WIT Interface Definition

```shell
ERROR tinygo build failed stderr=error: failed to encode a component from module
Caused by:
    0: failed to decode world from module
    1: module was not valid
    2: failed to resolve import `wasi:logging/logging@0.1.0-draft::log`
    3: module requires an import interface named `wasi:logging/logging@0.1.0-draft`
`wasm-tools component new` failed: exit status 1
TinyGo build failed: error: failed to encode a component from module
Caused by:
    0: failed to decode world from module
    1: module was not valid
    2: failed to resolve import `wasi:logging/logging@0.1.0-draft::log`
    3: module requires an import interface named `wasi:logging/logging@0.1.0-draft`
`wasm-tools component new` failed: exit status 1
```
**What happened:** `wash` could not find the WIT definition.

**What to do:** Verify that your WIT definition is available at the expected path.

##### World Not Found - Defaults to CLI

```shell
➜ wash inspect ./build/output.wasm 
package root:component;
world root {
  import wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.0;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.0;
  export wasi:cli/run@0.2.0;
}
```
**What happened:** If TinyGo can't find the specified world for some reason, it assumes that you are targeting `wasi:cli/run` instead of your intended target world.

**What to do:** Verify that you have correctly specified your target world in the configuration file and that your WIT definition is in the expected path.
