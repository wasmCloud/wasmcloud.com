# Wasm Shell (wash) CLI

### **Wasm Shell** (`wash`) is the comprehensive command-line tool for developing, building, and publishing WebAssembly components. 

The CLI provides an intuitive developer experience for the modern Wasm ecosystem, from project scaffolding to building and pushing components to OCI registries.

The Wasm Shell CLI is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash) as part of the open source [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmCloud) project, hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). 

## Install `wash`

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
  <TabItem value="macoslinux" label="macOS and Linux" default>

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmcloud/wash/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

On a successful installation, the script will return:

```shell
[INFO] Next steps:
  1. Add /path/to to your PATH if not already included
  2. Run 'wash --help' to see available commands
  3. Run 'wash doctor' to verify your environment
  4. Run 'wash new' to create your first WebAssembly component
```

Add `wash` to your PATH with the filepath listed in Step 1, replacing `/path/to` with your local filepath:

```shell
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wash"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmcloud/wash/refs/heads/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

```powershell
Next steps:
  1. Add /path/to to your PATH if not already included
  2. Run 'wash --help' to see available commands
  3. Run 'wash doctor' to verify your environment
  4. Run 'wash new' to create your first WebAssembly component
```

To add `wash` to your PATH by updating your PowerShell profile, add the filepath for `wash` returned above to your profile, replacing `/path/to` with your local filepath:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```
```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\path\to\wash"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="source" label="Source">

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash.git
cd wash
cargo install --path .
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash/releases).

## What does `wash` do?

:::note[]
This quick command tour requires the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the `wasm32-wasip2` target for Rust: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`
:::

Check your environment for component development dependencies:

   ```shell
   wash doctor
   ```

Create a new component:

   ```shell
   wash new https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash.git --subfolder examples/http-hello-world
   ```

Build a component project into a WebAssembly binary:

   ```shell
   wash -C ./http-hello-world build
   ```

Start a component development loop:

   ```shell
   wash -C ./http-hello-world dev
   ```

Update `wash`:

   ```shell
   wash update
   ```

## Next steps

* Explore the `wash` CLI's [Command Reference](./commands.mdx).
* Read the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide/index.mdx) to create a WebAssembly component.
