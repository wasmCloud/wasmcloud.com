Lattices are designed to support multi-tenancy in that you can run multiple, isolated lattices on the same NATS cluster, without risking overlapping traffic. This is made possible through the use of a unique lattice name. The NATS subject hierarchy is sub-divided beneath this name.

If you don't specify a name, wasmCloud will use `default`. This is fine when you're working on your development machine in isolation, but when you're running in a production environment, you might want to consider providing an explicit name for the lattice to avoid any chance of accidental overlap.

The main thing to be wary of is running multiple lattices without specifying a name, as they will all adopt the `default` name and merge into one unified lattice.

### Character sets

To ensure compatibility with current and future wasmcloud protocols, certain tokens should be limited to the character sets defined below.

| name           | characters     | description                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lattice_name   | `a-zA-Z0-9_-`  | Ascii uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, underscore, and dash |
| link_name      | `a-zA-Z0-9_-`  | same as lattice_name chars                                          |
| contract_name  | `a-zA-Z0-9_-:` | same as lattice_name chars, plus colon                              |
