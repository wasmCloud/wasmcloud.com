The wasmCloud lattice makes use of a _distributed cache_ for lattice-wide metadata. The information in this cache is required to allow a lattice to function properly. It contains the following information:

- Claims - JWTs are stored for both providers and actors
- Link Definitions
- OCI References - a mapping between OCI URLs and public keys

The persistence and implementation of this cache is actually a [NATS JetStream Key-Value Bucket](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream/kv).

### Default Configuration

When any wasmCloud host starts up, it will create this bucket with the default configuration if it does not yet exist. The bucket name will always be `LATTICEDATA_{lattice-id}`, where `lattice-id` is the unique identifier for the lattice. The default configuration for this bucket is to be unlimited in size and have a single replica.

### Production Configuration

The default configuration is fine for local development and testing, but is not suitable for production deploys. **It is strongly recommended to configure this bucket with 3 or more replicas**, and to configure backups of this data.

To change the number of replicas, the maximum size of the bucket, or any other configuration, create a KV bucket via the `nats` CLI **_before_** the first wasmCloud host starts. If the host detects a pre-existing KV bucket when it starts, it will simply reuse it.

:::warning
It is _strongly_ recommended that developers _never_ interact with the KV bucket contents directly, and instead use the various operations available on the lattice control interface via the `wash` CLI, in order to ensure stability of the bucket's contents. Manually editing these values could result in corrupted data and unpredictable behavior by hosts.
:::

To query the contents of the KV bucket, use the `wash` CLI tool to interact with the control interface. For example, to get the list of all link definitions in the lattice, use `wash get links`. A full list of available commands is available in the [wash documentation](/docs/0.82/cli/get).
