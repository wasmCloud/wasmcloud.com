`wadm` releases include a standalone binary and Docker image.

### Standalone Binary

- Linux (x86_64)
- Linux (aarch64)
- MacOS (x86_64)

:::

After downloading the appropriate release, extract the `wadm` binary and move it somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `mv wadm /usr/local/bin/wadm`).

### Docker

A list of all available wadm images is on [GitHub packages](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/pkgs/container/wadm). In addition to tagged versions, we also have two additional tags:

- `latest` - The latest tagged release of wadm
- `canary` - The latest build of wadm from the `main` branch. **This is not recommended for production use.**
