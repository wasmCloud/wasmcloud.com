:::info
These guides are for deploying `wadm` in **production**. For local development and testing, simply run `wash up`. For more information on `wadm`, see the [`wadm` docs](/docs/0.82/category/declarative-application-deployment-wadm).

### High availability and horizontal scaling by default

`wadm` is designed to be resilient, flexible, and easy to scale from a single instance to many. **No configuration is required to run additional instances.**

Each instance establishes and maintains in-memory state of a lattice based off [events](/docs/0.82/reference/cloud-event-list) emitted by hosts in the lattice, which means `wadm` instances can be restarted or scaled up and down without impacting the management of the lattice.

Instances of `wadm` do not need to be run on the same system as a wasmCloud host; the only requirement is that instances have access to internal NATS subjects used by [lattices](/docs/0.82/concepts/lattice).

### Single lattice management

The simplest deployment pattern is to run a group of (one or more) `wadm` instances per lattice. This simplifies the requirements for the NATS credentials, since `wadm` only needs to subscribe to events and emit commands related to a single lattice. See [Configuring NATS Credentials](/docs/0.82/deployment/wadm/nats-credentials) for information on how to configure NATS credentials for `wadm`.

### Multi-lattice management

This pattern is slightly more complex than the single lattice management pattern. In this pattern, `wadm` manages multiple lattices associated with the same NATS cluster. This is useful for multi-tenant deployments of wasmCloud, managing a dev and staging environment together, etc.

Configuring `wadm` to manage multiple lattices is straightforward. The only additional requirement to configure `wadm` for multi-lattice management is ensuring the NATS credentials provided to `wadm` have permission on topics for _all_ lattices. For more information, see [Configuring NATS Credentials](/docs/0.82/deployment/wadm/nats-credentials)
