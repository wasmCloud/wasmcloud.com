wasmCloud hosts can be configured at start time with a variety of [host config](/docs/0.82/reference/host-config) options. However, in some production deploys, it is useful to provide supplemental configuration to a host from an external source.

For example, wasmCloud hosts can be configured to pull artifacts from private OCI registries. The host can be started with credentials to a single registry, but in cases where multiple registries are used to host artifacts, a config service can be used to provide credentials for multiple registries to hosts.

**The config service is disabled by default.** When enabled, wasmCloud hosts will make a request to `wasmbus.cfg.{lattice-id}.req` during initialization.

### Config Requests and Responses

When making a request for configuration, the host provides its [labels](/docs/0.82/deployment/hosts/labels) as the payload:

```json
{
  "labels": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "qux"
  }
}
```

In response, the host receives supplemental configuration. At this time, the only configuration returned is a set of credentials for [OCI registries](/docs/0.82/deployment/oci):

```json
{
  "registryCredentials": {
    "someregistry.io": {
      "username": "user1",
      "password": "hunter2"
    },
    "anotherregistry.io": {
      "username": "myuser",
      "password": "asecurepassword"
    }
  }
}
```

### Hosting a Config Service

Since the config service API is over NATS, it can be implemented by anything that can subscribe and publish responses to `wasmbus.cfg.{lattice-id}.req` (including a wasmCloud actor!).
