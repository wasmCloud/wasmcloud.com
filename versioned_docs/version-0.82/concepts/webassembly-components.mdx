## Overview

[WebAssembly components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) are the unit of compute for wasmCloud. Components are containers for WebAssembly modules (or other sub-components), which can depend on and expose interfaces. This aligns well with wasmCloud's approach to building distributed applications via the [actor model](/docs/0.82/concepts/actors) and [interface-driven development](/docs/0.82/concepts/interface-driven-development).

### Embracing Standards

The Component Model is an emerging standard for WebAssembly, and wasmCloud contributors and maintainers have been actively involved in helping make it a reality. wasmCloud believes that the Component Model is the future of WebAssembly and is committed to supporting a componentized ecosystem.

The wasmCloud host remains up-to-date with the latest versions of [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) and [WASI Preview 2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/preview2/README.md), a set of interfaces designed to allow WebAssembly components to access external resources in a safe and portable way.
