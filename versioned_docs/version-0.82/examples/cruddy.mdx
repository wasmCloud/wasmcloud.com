<h3>Build and deploy a CRUDdy Wasm component</h3>

This tutorial will show you how to create and deploy a distributed WebAssembly application with wasmCloud, using Python, Rust, Go, or TypeScript. Building on what you've learned in the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world), we'll explore the fundamentals of wasmCloud development by making a simple guestbook that performs [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations using several **capabilities**&mdash;abstracted requirements like HTTP handling or key-value storage, fulfilled by [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/webassembly-components). 

By the end, you'll understand how you can use wasmCloud to orchestrate components and build a distributed application. Along the way, you'll learn how to create a component from scratch and how to use **WebAssembly Standard Interface (WASI)** APIs. 

Let's get going!

:::info[Wait, what is a WebAssembly component?]
A component is portable Wasm code that is interoperable with any other component, regardless of the language in which each component was written. The interoperability of WebAssembly components drives wasmCloud's "building blocks" approach&mdash;you can write original code in any language that compiles to WebAssembly and then plug in the capabilities you need (e.g. HTTP) without worrying about how that functionality is implemented. Learn more about WebAssembly components in the [Concepts](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) section.
:::

## Before you get started

In this tutorial, we'll be using two core tools at the heart of wasmCloud: the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** and **wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (`wadm`)**. 

* **`wash`** provides a command-line interface for wasmCloud, helping you run hosts, build and deploy components, and manage your installation.
* **`wadm`** orchestrates wasmCloud workloads according to declarative manifests. 

If you haven't installed wasmCloud already, head on over to the [installation instructions](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) and then return here. 

:::info[Versions and compatibility]
This tutorial uses **wasmCloud v0.82** and first-party providers designed for **WASI HTTP 0.2.0** and **WASI Key-Value Store 0.1.0**. You shouldn't have to worry about WASI API versions, since the API definitions come packaged with the wasmCloud templates used here.

You will also need both the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the `wasm32-wasi` target installed on the same machine. `wash` depends on the Rust toolchain to compile Rust code to Wasm. 

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

## Creating a new component

In wasmCloud, an [**application component**](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) is a WebAssembly component dedicated to an application's creative logic. Typically, we will simply refer to this as a "component." Historically, wasmCloud referred to this piece of an application as an "actor," but that term is deprecated in favor of "component" and CLI commands will change as of v1.0.

With `wash` installed, you can run the following command in your shell to create a new component from a simple template: 

```shell
wash new actor cruddy-rust --git wasmcloud/wasmcloud --subfolder examples/rust/actors/http-hello-world --branch 0.82-examples
```

This command instructs `wash` to create a new component called "`cruddy-rust`". For our template, we're using the `http-hello-world` template from the 0.82 branch of the wasmCloud project repo on GitHub. The `new actor` command always creates new components from templates&mdash;if you don't specify one from the outset, `wash` will provide you with a set of options.

The repo we're using gives us the skeleton for a new component in Rust. Let's take a look at the `cruddy-rust` directory:

```shell
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
├── wadm.yaml
├── wasmcloud.toml
└── wit
```

Here we have the standard Rust project files as well as three pieces that make up a wasmCloud application component:

* **`wadm.yaml`** is a declarative deployment manifest used by `wadm`. 
* **`wasmcloud.toml`** is a metadata and permissions configuration file for the application component.
* The **`wit`** directory holds **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** definitions for standard APIs used across the Wasm ecosystem&mdash;we'll discuss these at greater length in a moment.

Let's open `wasmcloud.toml` and have a look around:

```toml
name = "http-hello-world"
language = "rust"
type = "actor"
version = "0.1.0"

[actor]
wit_world = "hello"
wasm_target = "wasm32-wasi-preview2"
```

Here we have metadata for details like naming and versioning. For now, we're most interested in the `[actor]` fields: 

* **`wit_world`** points the application to a set of interfaces (known as a "world") defined in the `wit` directory.
* **`wasm_target`** specifies the Wasm compilation target.

Now let's take a look at the `wit` directory.

## Understanding WIT dependencies

We will interact with the `httpserver` and `keyvalue` capabilities via **WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)** APIs&mdash;ecosystem-standard APIs used for communication with and between components. 

:::info[Where does WASI fit in the development cycle?]
WASI is especially useful for building and maintaining standard and popular libraries in an efficient and language-agnostic way&mdash;so developers can focus on writing simple, portable, idiomatic code.
:::

Take a look at the contents of `wit`:

```shell
├── deps
├── deps.toml
└── world.wit
```
* `deps` is a directory that holds WIT definitions. 
* `deps.toml` is a TOML configuration file used to manage WIT dependencies.
* `world.wit` defines the interfaces that comprise your WIT "world."

Our template has pre-populated the `wit` directory with relevant definitions. However, if you wish to select your WIT dependencies and populate the directory yourself, you can use the [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) tool.

Open `deps.toml`. Here we have specified interfaces that we wish to utilize in our app. WASI interfaces like `wasi-http` or `wasi-keyvalue` are [available to browse in the WebAssembly project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md). 

WIT definitions contain documentation as comments within the WIT files themselves. It is very useful to read through the WIT comprehensively before using a new interface. 

Take a look at `/deps/http/types.wit`. Here you'll find a detailed explanation of the interface's types. Note the `outgoing-request` type&mdash;it will come up again in a moment.

```
/// Represents an outgoing HTTP Request.
resource outgoing-request 
```

With our WIT dependencies in place, we can specify interface imports and exports in `world.wit`. A **WIT world** is a set of standard interfaces that you can use to interact with components via defined functions and types. The WIT interfaces don't provide functionality in themselves&mdash;instead, they provide a common language for the *contracts* between components. 

Remember that we targeted the `hello` world in our `wasmcloud.toml` file; this is where that world is defined.  Let's update the `hello` world in `world.wit`:

```wit
package wasmcloud:hello;

world hello {
  import wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0; // [!code ++]
  // [!code ++]
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

The `wasmcloud.toml` file points to the `hello` world in `world.wit`, and the `hello` world connects to our WIT definitions. 

Now that our dependencies are defined, we're ready to get coding.

## Working with WASI APIs

Open `src/lib.rs`. 

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!({
    world: "hello",
    exports: {
        "wasi:http/incoming-handler": HttpServer,
    },
});

use exports::wasi::http::incoming_handler::Guest;
use wasi::http::types::*;

struct HttpServer;

impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) {
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();
        response_body
            .write()
            .unwrap()
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n")
            .unwrap();
        OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
        ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
    }
}
```
Most of this file is simple boilerplate. We've made WASI APIs available, but how do we *use* those APIs in Rust?

The answer is in the first lines. When we build the application with the `wash build` command, the builder will use these instructions to run the built-in `wit-bindgen` tool and generate bindings between the functions we saw in the WIT dependencies and Rust.

Let's try it out. In the root of the project directory:

```shell
wash build
```

This will create a `build` directory with a compiled `.wasm` artifact for the app. It will also create a `target` directory including dependencies such as the generated bindings. 

In Rust, using WASI APIs is fairly intuitive, especially with IDE suggestions and autofills. If we've read through the `keyvalue` WIT, we know that we will need an instance of the `OutgoingValue` type later. We can create it this way:

```rust
// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new outgoing-value resource
let value: OutgoingValue = 
  wasi::keyvalue::types::OutgoingValue::new_outgoing_value();
```

At each stage from `wasi::` to `keyvalue::` to `types::` and beyond, our IDE can provide us with the available options as documented in the WIT. Taken in conjunction, our WIT files and code completion gives us the tools we need to use the API and put the pieces together. For now, put this at the top of our handler function.

So what else do we have in `lib.rs`?

Most of the code is in a `handle` function responding to requests:

```rust
impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) {
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();
        response_body
            .write()
            .unwrap()
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n")
            .unwrap();
        OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
        ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
    }
}
```

Now, at the top of the `handle` function, we'll use the WASI HTTP API's `path_with_query` method on our incoming request&mdash;much like in the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world). This will extract and return a name provided in incoming HTTP queries. (While we're at it, we'll delete the response body, as we'll be replacing that soon.)

```rust
impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) { // [!code --]
    fn handle(request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) { // [!code ++]
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();
        let name = match request // [!code ++:11]
            .path_with_query()
            .unwrap()
            .split("=")
            .collect::<Vec<&str>>()[..]
        {
            // query string is "/?name=<name>" e.g. localhost:8080?name=Bob
            ["/?name", name] => name.to_string(),
            // query string is anything else or empty e.g. localhost:8080
            _ => "Anonymous".to_string(),
        };
        response_body // [!code --]
            .write() // [!code --]
            .unwrap() // [!code --]
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n") // [!code --]
            .unwrap(); // [!code --]
        OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body"); // [!code --]
        ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response)); // [!code --]
```

This is the first time we're actually implementing a new WASI method in this component, so we should pause to consider exactly what we're doing:

* When we look at our WIT bindings, we can see that `IncomingRequest` has a method `path_with_query()`. The original WIT tell us that `path_with_query()` returns a string of the request path, including any query. However, the string is contained within a return object and needs to be "unwrapped."
* To get at the actual value, we use the `unwrap()` method.
* To isolate the name, we split the value at the `=` and collect it as a `<Vec<&str>>` that we can use elsewhere.

In order to guide our CRUD operations for the guestbook, we'd also like to know the method of the incoming request. We can detect that with the API as well. Try finding the method of the request with what you've learned so far.

If you guessed that you could use a method on `request`, well done! Below the previous line add:

```rust
// Detect method // [!code ++]
let method = request.method(); // [!code ++]
```

This will return a method of the `Method` type, which we will be able to use directly.

We've implemented our basic HTTP operations. Now let's turn to key-value storage.  

## Adding CRUD 

We can follow the same procedure we used for `wasi-http` to explore the wasi-keyvalue API and start adding CRUD operations.  

In `/wit/deps/keyvalue/types.wit`, we see that collections of key-value pairs are referenced as `buckets` in the API:

```
	/// A bucket is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is stored
	/// as a entry in the bucket, and the bucket itself acts as a collection of all
	/// these entries.
	///
	/// It is worth noting that the exact terminology for bucket in key-value stores
	/// can very depending on the specific implementation. For example,
	/// 1. Amazon DynamoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a table
	/// 2. Redis has hashes, sets, and sorted sets as different types of collections
	/// 3. Cassandra calls a collection of key-value pairs a column family
	/// 4. MongoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a collection
	/// 5. Riak calls a collection of key-value pairs a bucket
	/// 6. Memcached calls a collection of key-value pairs a slab
	/// 7. Azure Cosmos DB calls a collection of key-value pairs a container
	///
	/// In this interface, we use the term `bucket` to refer to a collection of key-value
```
We'd like to open a bucket to store the names of our guests, so we'll add the following to our handler function between the `method` and `value` assignments:

```rust
// Open keyvaluestore bucket // [!code ++]
// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new bucket resource // [!code ++]
let bucket = // [!code ++]
    wasi::keyvalue::types::Bucket::open_bucket("").expect("failed to open empty bucket"); // [!code ++]
```
Next we'll create a variable called `value` of the `OutgoingValue` type that will hold the new values assigned to keys in PUT/set operations. This is a `wasi-keyvalue` pattern that we would use in any language: the `new_outgoing_value()` method is creating a new resource, which we can use to perform synchronous write operations. 

```rust
// Create a variable for outgoing values - Put/sets will use this // [!code ++]
// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new outgoing-value resource // [!code ++]
let value: OutgoingValue = // [!code ++]
    wasi::keyvalue::types::OutgoingValue::new_outgoing_value(); // [!code ++]
```

Now we'll add a switch case that **creates/updates**, **reads**, or **destroys** guestbook records based on the HTTP method of the incoming request. For this rudimentary app, each case will send an appropriate HTTP response:

```rust
// Switch case on method // [!code ++]
        match method { // [!code ++]
            wasi::http::types::Method::Get => { // [!code ++]
            // [!code ++]
                // If the key doesn't exist, then the value will be returned as none, so we're checking for noneness to handle errors // [!code ++]
                let none = wasi::keyvalue::eventual::get(&bucket, &name).unwrap().is_none(); // [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
                if none { // [!code ++]
                    // Send error message if the value is none // [!code ++]
                    response_body // [!code ++]
                        .write() // [!code ++]
                        .unwrap() // [!code ++]
                        .blocking_write_and_flush(format!("{name} not found").as_bytes()) // [!code ++]
                        .unwrap(); // [!code ++]
                    OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body"); // [!code ++]
                    ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response)); // [!code ++]
                } else { // [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
                    let result = wasi::keyvalue::eventual::get(&bucket, &name).unwrap().unwrap(); // [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
                    // Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get a uint8 byte array, which we will then send as part of http response // [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
                    let in_val = wasi::keyvalue::types::IncomingValue::incoming_value_consume_sync(result).unwrap(); // [!code ++]
                // [!code ++]
                    // Send HTTP response // [!code ++]
                    response_body // [!code ++]
                        .write() // [!code ++]
                        .unwrap() // [!code ++]
                        .blocking_write_and_flush(&in_val).unwrap(); // [!code ++]
                    OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body"); // [!code ++]
                    ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response)); // [!code ++]
                }; // [!code ++]
 // [!code ++]
            }, // [!code ++]
            wasi::http::types::Method::Put => { // [!code ++]
                // Assign value as byte array // [!code ++]
                let writval = format!("attending").as_bytes().to_vec(); // [!code ++]
         // [!code ++]
                // Use outgoingvaluewritebodysync to actually write the value // [!code ++]
                let _ = value.outgoing_value_write_body_sync(&writval); // [!code ++]
                        // [!code ++]
                wasi::keyvalue::eventual::set(&bucket, &name, &value) // [!code ++]
                        .expect("failed to set"); // [!code ++]
                // [!code ++]
                // Send HTTP response // [!code ++]
                response_body // [!code ++]
                    .write() // [!code ++]
                    .unwrap() // [!code ++]
                    .blocking_write_and_flush(format!("Added {name}").as_bytes()) // [!code ++]
                    .unwrap(); // [!code ++]
                OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body"); // [!code ++]
                ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response)); // [!code ++]
            }, // [!code ++]
            wasi::http::types::Method::Delete => { // [!code ++:27]

                // If the key doesn't exist, then the value will be returned as none, so we're checking for noneness to handle errors
                let none = wasi::keyvalue::eventual::get(&bucket, &name).unwrap().is_none();

                if none {
                    // Send error message if the value is none
                    response_body
                        .write()
                        .unwrap()
                        .blocking_write_and_flush(format!("{name} not found").as_bytes())
                        .unwrap();
                    OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
                    ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
                } else {
                    // Delete key
                    let _ = wasi::keyvalue::eventual::delete(&bucket, &name);

                    // Send HTTP response
                    response_body
                        .write()
                        .unwrap()
                        .blocking_write_and_flush(format!("It's like {name} was never there").as_bytes())
                        .unwrap();
                    OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
                    ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
                };
            } // [!code ++]
            _ => { // [!code ++]
                // Handle other cases // [!code ++]
                // Send HTTP response // [!code ++]
                response_body // [!code ++]
                    .write() // [!code ++]
                    .unwrap() // [!code ++]
                    .blocking_write_and_flush(format!("Try sending a GET, PUT, or DELETE").as_bytes()) // [!code ++]
                    .unwrap(); // [!code ++]
                OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body"); // [!code ++]
                ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response)); // [!code ++]
            } // [!code ++]
        }; // [!code ++]
```

Most of our application logic is happening in this block, so let's pause to consider a few important elements. 

The condition for each case is the request method returned to the `method` variable. Within the conditionals, each CRUD operation runs against `bucket` and `name`. In the case of `wasi::keyvalue::eventual::delete`, that's extremely straightforward, since no data is being passed. The `set` and `get` operations are just a touch more complicated. 

For the `set`, we use the `outgoing_value_write_body_sync` method to write the body of the value (defined as a Vec of bytes in `writval`) to `value`. With our value written to `value`, we can pass it into `wasi::keyvalue::eventual::set`.

The `get` logic is similar but runs in reverse. `wasi::keyvalue::eventual::get` gives us a result that must be unwrapped and then consumed with `wasi::keyvalue::types::IncomingValue::incoming_value_consume_sync`, which gives us a byte array. Byte arrays are a common unit of data in WASI interfaces&mdash;note how we use them in HTTP responses as well. Since we have a byte array from our incoming value now, we can pass it directly to the HTTP response.

At this point, `lib.rs` should look like this:

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!({
    world: "hello",
    exports: {
        "wasi:http/incoming-handler": HttpServer,
    },
});

use exports::wasi::http::incoming_handler::Guest;
use wasi::{http::types::*, keyvalue::types::OutgoingValue};

struct HttpServer;

impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) { 
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();

        // Get any name appended to the path via query

                ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
            }
        };
        
    }
}
```

Since we've made changes to `lib.rs`, we'll build again to update the `.wasm` artifact:  

```shell
wash build
```

## Start Redis

Up front, we said that we don't have to worry about the underlying software that *provides* a capability until we deploy. Now it's time to start thinking about which **capability providers** we want to use. You can explore the [list of available capability providers](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers) in the wasmCloud GitHub repo. For key-value storage, we'll use Redis.  

Start a Redis server with either `redis-server` or Docker:  

```shell
redis-server &

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

## Prepare for deployment

The last step to deploy our component is preparing the declarative manifest in `wadm.yaml`, which defines the desired state for our application when it is running on wasmCloud. This will look familiar if you've used container orchestrators like Kubernetes. The manifest included with the `hello-world-rust` template looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: rust-http-hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "HTTP hello world demo in Rust, using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)"
    experimental: true
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-hello-world
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the actor
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        # Link the HTTP server, and inform it to listen on port 8080
        # on the local machine
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080

    # Add a capability provider that mediates HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver

```
The metadata fields provide naming and versioning for our application. We'll update the name to describe what we've built:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: rust-http-hello-world // [!code --]
  name: cruddy // [!code ++]
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "HTTP hello world demo in Rust, using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)" // [!code --]
	description: "CRUD demo" // [!code ++]
    experimental: true
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="TinyGo" default>

    You will also need both [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) installed on the same machine. `wash` depends on the TinyGo toolchain to compile Go code to Wasm. 

<h2>Creating a new component</h2>

In wasmCloud, an [**application component**](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) is a WebAssembly component dedicated to an application's creative logic. Typically, we will simply refer to this as a "component." Historically, wasmCloud referred to this piece of an application as an "actor," but that term is deprecated in favor of "component" and CLI commands will change as of v1.0.

With `wash` installed, you can run the following command in your shell to create a new component from a simple template: 

```shell
wash new actor cruddy --git wasmcloud/wasmcloud --subfolder examples/golang/actors/http-hello-world --branch 0.82-examples
```

This command instructs `wash` to create a new component called "`cruddy`". For our template, we're using the `http-hello-world` template from the 0.82 branch of the wasmCloud project repo on GitHub. The `new actor` command always creates new components from templates&mdash;if you don't specify one from the outset, `wash` will provide you with a set of options.

The repo we're using gives us the skeleton for a new actor in Go. Let's take a look at the `cruddy` directory:

```shell
├── go.mod
├── hello.go
├── wadm.yaml
├── wasmcloud.toml
└── wit
```

Here we have the standard `go.mod` file for a Go project and a `.go` file for the project. We also have three pieces that make up a wasmCloud actor:

* **`wadm.yaml`** is a declarative deployment manifest used by `wadm`. 
* **`wasmcloud.toml`** is a metadata and permissions configuration file for the actor.
* The **`wit`** directory holds **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** definitions for standard APIs used across the Wasm ecosystem&mdash;we'll discuss these at greater length in a moment.

Let's open `wasmcloud.toml` and have a look around:

```toml
name = "http-hello-world"
language = "tinygo"
type = "actor"
version = "0.1.0"

[actor]
wit_world = "hello"
wasm_target = "wasm32-wasi-preview2"
destination = "build/http_hello_world_s.wasm"
```

Here we have metadata for details like naming and versioning. For now, we're most interested in the three `[actor]` fields: 

* **`wit_world`** points the actor to a set of interfaces (known as a "world") defined in the `wit` directory.
* **`wasm_target`** specifies the Wasm compilation target.
* **`destination`** defines the name and location of the final, signed Wasm artifact for the component.

Now let's take a look at the `wit` directory.

<h2>Understanding WIT dependencies</h2>

We will interact with the `httpserver` and `keyvalue` capabilities via **WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)** APIs&mdash;ecosystem-standard APIs used for communication with and between components. 

:::info[Where does WASI fit in the development cycle?]
WASI is especially useful for building and maintaining standard and popular libraries in an efficient and language-agnostic way&mdash;so developers can focus on writing simple, portable, idiomatic code.
:::

Take a look at the contents of `wit`:

```
├── deps
├── deps.toml
└── world.wit
```
* `deps` is a directory that holds WIT definitions. 
* `deps.toml` is a TOML configuration file used to manage WIT dependencies.
* `world.wit` defines the interfaces that comprise your WIT "world."

Our template has pre-populated the `wit` directory with relevant definitions. However, if you wish to select your WIT dependencies and populate the directory yourself, you can use the [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) tool.

Open `deps.toml`. Here we have specified interfaces that we wish to utilize in our app. WASI interfaces like `wasi-http` or `wasi-keyvalue` are [available to browse in the WebAssembly project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md). 

WIT definitions contain documentation as comments within the WIT files themselves. It is very useful to read through the WIT comprehensively before using a new interface. 

Take a look at `/deps/http/types.wit`. Here you'll find a detailed explanation of the interface's types. Note the `outgoing-request` type&mdash;it will come up again in a moment.

```
/// Represents an outgoing HTTP Request.
resource outgoing-request 
```

With our WIT dependencies in place, we can specify interface imports and exports in `world.wit`. A **WIT world** is a set of standard interfaces that you can use to interact with components via defined functions and types. The WIT interfaces don't provide functionality in themselves&mdash;instead, they provide a common language for the *contracts* between components. 

Remember that we targeted the `hello` world in our `wasmcloud.toml` file; this is where that world is defined.  Let's update the `hello` world in `world.wit`:

```
package wasmcloud:hello;

world hello {
  import wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0; // [!code ++]
  // [!code ++]
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

The `wasmcloud.toml` file points to the `hello` world in `world.wit`, and the `hello` world connects to our WIT definitions. 

Now that our dependencies are defined, we're ready to get coding.

<h2>Working with WASI APIs in your Go code</h2>

Open `hello.go`. 

```go
package main

import (
	http "github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud/examples/golang/actors/http-hello-world/gen"
)

// Helper type aliases to make code more readable
type HttpRequest = http.ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerIncomingRequest
type HttpResponseWriter = http.ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerResponseOutparam
type HttpOutgoingResponse = http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesOutgoingResponse
type HttpError = http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesErrorCode

type HttpServer struct{}

func init() {
	httpserver := HttpServer{}
	// Set the incoming handler struct to HttpServer
	http.SetExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandler(httpserver)
}

func (h HttpServer) Handle(request HttpRequest, responseWriter HttpResponseWriter) {
	// Construct HttpResponse to send back
	headers := http.NewFields()
	httpResponse := http.NewOutgoingResponse(headers)
	httpResponse.SetStatusCode(200)
	httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush([]uint8("Hello from Go!\n")).Unwrap()

	// Send HTTP response
	okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
	http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)
}

//go:generate wit-bindgen tiny-go wit --out-dir=gen --gofmt
func main() {}

```
Most of this file is simple boilerplate. We'd like to use the WASI APIs that we've made available, but where can we learn how to *use* those APIs in Go?

The answer is in the penultimate line. When we build the application with the `wash build` command, the builder will use these instructions to run the built-in `wit-bindgen` tool and generate bindings between the functions we saw in the WIT dependencies and Go (specifically TinyGo).

Let's try it out. In the root of the project directory:

```shell
wash build
```

This will create a `build` directory with a compiled `.wasm` artifact for the app. It will also create a `gen` directory for bindings. 

Open the new `hello.go` file in the `gen` directory. You will find a lengthy file defining the bindings between the functions and types in your WIT world and their implementations in Go. Take, for example, the `outgoing-response` type that we observed in `types.wit`. We can find the binding in `gen/hello.go` (Try searching the file for "outgoing-response"):

```go
// WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesOutgoingResponse is a handle to imported resource outgoing-response
type WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesOutgoingResponse int32
```

Taken in conjunction, our WIT files and our generated bindings give us the tools we need to use the API and put the pieces together. If you return to our root `hello.go` project file, you'll notice that we're importing `<project-name>/gen` as `http`, so the Go file can access the WIT bindings for the WIT world. We've already used `WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesOutgoingResponse`, giving it the simpler shorthand of `HttpOutgoingResponse`.  

What else do we have in our `hello.go` file?

First, we have three more helper types and a struct for the server. While we're here, let's add a helper type for `OutgoingValue`&mdash;if we've read through the `wasi:keyvalue` WIT, we know this will simplify key-value operations later on.

```go
type HttpRequest = http.ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerIncomingRequest
type HttpResponseWriter = http.ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerResponseOutparam
type HttpOutgoingResponse = http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesOutgoingResponse
type HttpError = http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesErrorCode
type OutgoingValue = http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_TypesOutgoingValue // [!code ++]

type HttpServer struct{}

```
In the `init` function, we have the `HttpServer` struct set as the handler for incoming requests:

```go
func init() {
	httpserver := HttpServer{}
	// Set the incoming handler struct to HttpServer
	http.SetExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandler(httpserver)
}
```

Next we have a function responding to requests:

```go
func (h HttpServer) Handle(request HttpRequest, responseWriter HttpResponseWriter) {
	// Construct HttpResponse to send back
	headers := http.NewFields()
	httpResponse := http.NewOutgoingResponse(headers)
	httpResponse.SetStatusCode(200)
	httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush([]uint8("Hello from Go!\n")).Unwrap()

	// Send HTTP response
	okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
	http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)
}
```

Finally, we have commented directions for wasmCloud's `wash` builder and the main function call. 

Now, below the handler function, add a new function called `getName`&mdash;much like in the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world). This will extract and return a name provided in incoming HTTP queries:

```go
func getName(path string) string {
	parts := strings.Split(path, "=")
	if len(parts) == 2 {
		return parts[1]
	}
	return "Anonymous"
}
```

Call `getName` at the top of the handler function. We'll use the `PathWithQuery` method from the WASI HTTP API to grab the path and query from the incoming request:

```go
	// Get any name appended to the path via query
	name := getName(request.PathWithQuery().Unwrap())
```

This is the first time we're actually implementing a new WASI method in this component, so we should pause to consider exactly what we're doing: 

* We've defined `request` as the `HttpRequest` type at the top of the function, and `HttpRequest` is a helper alias for `ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerIncomingRequest`.
* When we look at our WIT bindings, we can see that `ExportsWasiHttp0_2_0_IncomingHandlerIncomingRequest` has a method `PathWithQuery`. Both the bindings file and the original WIT tell us that `PathWithQuery` returns a string of the request path, including any query. However, the string is contained within a return object and needs to be "unwrapped."
* To get at the actual value, we use the `Unwrap()` method. 

In order to guide our CRUD operations for the guestbook, we'd also like to know the method of the incoming request. We can detect that with the API as well. Try finding the method of the request with what you've learned so far.

If you guessed that you could use a method on `request` again, well done! Below the previous line add:

```go
	// Detect request method
	method := request.Method()
```

This will return a method of the `WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesMethod` type, which we will be able to use directly.

We've implemented our basic HTTP operations. Now let's turn to key-value storage.  

<h2>Adding CRUD</h2> 

We can follow the same procedure we used for `wasi-http` to explore the wasi-keyvalue API and start adding CRUD operations.  

In `/wit/deps/keyvalue/types.wit`, we see that collections of key-value pairs are referenced as `buckets` in the API:

```
	/// A bucket is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is stored
	/// as a entry in the bucket, and the bucket itself acts as a collection of all
	/// these entries.
	///
	/// It is worth noting that the exact terminology for bucket in key-value stores
	/// can very depending on the specific implementation. For example,
	/// 1. Amazon DynamoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a table
	/// 2. Redis has hashes, sets, and sorted sets as different types of collections
	/// 3. Cassandra calls a collection of key-value pairs a column family
	/// 4. MongoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a collection
	/// 5. Riak calls a collection of key-value pairs a bucket
	/// 6. Memcached calls a collection of key-value pairs a slab
	/// 7. Azure Cosmos DB calls a collection of key-value pairs a container
	///
	/// In this interface, we use the term `bucket` to refer to a collection of key-value
```
Peruse the `/gen/hello.go` file to explore the Go bindings. (Searching `bucket` in the file is a quick way to find the relevant details.) We'd like to open a bucket to store the names of our guests, so we'll add the following to our handler function below the `getName` call:

```go
	// Open keyvaluestore bucket
	// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new bucket resource
	bucket := http.StaticBucketOpenBucket("").Unwrap()
```
This is another case where we need to use the `Unwrap()` method, because on its own `StaticBucketOpenBucket("")` returns an object containing both the bucket and an error (if applicable).

Next we'll create a variable called `outVal` that will hold the new values assigned to keys in PUT/set operations. This is a `wasi-keyvalue` pattern that we would use in any language: the `StaticOutgoingValueNewOutgoingValue()` method is creating a new resource, which we can use to perform synchronous write operations. 

```go
	// Create a variable for outgoing values - Put/sets will use this
	// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new outgoing-value resource
	outVal := OutgoingValue(http.StaticOutgoingValueNewOutgoingValue())
```

Now we'll replace our existing response with a switch case that **creates/updates**, **reads**, or **destroys** guestbook records based on the HTTP method of the incoming request. For this rudimentary app, each case will send an appropriate HTTP response:

```go
	// Build the HttpResponse to send back
	headers := http.NewFields()
	httpResponse := http.NewOutgoingResponse(headers)
	httpResponse.SetStatusCode(200)

	switch method {
	case http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesMethodGet():

		// If the key doesn't exist, then the value will be returned as none, so we're checking for noneness to handle errors
		none := http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualGet(bucket, name).Unwrap().IsNone()

		if none {
			// Send error message if value is none
			httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush([]uint8(name + " not found\n")).Unwrap()
			okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
			http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)

		} else {

			result := http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualGet(bucket, name).Unwrap().Unwrap()

			// Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get a uint8 byte array, which we will then send as part of http response

			incomingValue := http.StaticIncomingValueIncomingValueConsumeSync(result).Unwrap()

			httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush(incomingValue).Unwrap()
			okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
			http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)
		}

	case http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesMethodPut():

		// Write the desired value (as byte array) in our variable
		outVal.OutgoingValueWriteBodySync([]uint8(fmt.Sprintf("attending")))

		// Set the value
		http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualSet(bucket, name, outVal)

		okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
		http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)

	case http.WasiHttp0_2_0_TypesMethodDelete():

		// If the key doesn't exist, then the value will be returned as none, so we're checking for noneness to handle errors

		} else {

			result := http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualGet(bucket, name).Unwrap().Unwrap()

			// Delete the key value pair
			http.WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualDelete(bucket, name)

			// Send HTTP response

			httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush([]uint8(message + "\n")).Unwrap()
			okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
			http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)
		}

	default:
		message := "Try sending a GET, PUT, or DELETE"
		httpResponse.Body().Unwrap().Write().Unwrap().BlockingWriteAndFlush([]uint8(message + "\n")).Unwrap()
		okResponse := http.Ok[HttpOutgoingResponse, HttpError](httpResponse)
		http.StaticResponseOutparamSet(responseWriter, okResponse)
	}
```

Most of our application logic is happening in this block, so let's pause to consider a few important elements. 

The condition for each case is the request method returned to the `method` variable. Within the conditionals, each CRUD operation runs against `bucket` and `name`. In the case of `WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualDelete`, that's pretty straightforward, since no data is being passed. The `set` and `get` operations are just a touch more complicated. 

For the `set`, we use the `OutgoingValueWriteBodySync` method to write the body of the value to `outVal`. The value must be written as a `[]uint8` byte array. With our value written to `outVal`, we can pass it into `WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualSet`.

The `get` logic is similar but runs in reverse. `WasiKeyvalue0_1_0_EventualGet` gives us a result that must be unwrapped and then consumed with `StaticIncomingValueIncomingValueConsumeSync`, which gives us a byte array. Byte arrays are a common unit of data in WASI interfaces&mdash;note how we use them in HTTP responses as well. Since we have a byte array from our incoming value now, we can pass it directly to the HTTP response.

At this point, `hello.go` should look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	http "github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud/examples/golang/actors/http-hello-world/gen"

func init() {
	httpserver := HttpServer{}
	// Set the incoming handler struct to HttpServer

	// Get any name appended to the path via query

	// Detect request method
	method := request.Method()

	// Open keyvaluestore bucket
	// In the language of WASI, here we're creating a new bucket resource
	bucket := http.StaticBucketOpenBucket("").Unwrap()

	// Create a variable for outgoing values - Put/sets will use this

Since we've made changes to `hello.go`, we'll build again to update the `.wasm` artifact:  

```shell
wash build
```

<h2>Start Redis</h2>

Up front, we said that we don't have to worry about the underlying software that *provides* a capability until we deploy. Now it's time to start thinking about which **capability providers** we want to use. You can explore the [list of available capability providers](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers) in the wasmCloud GitHub repo. For key-value storage, we'll use Redis.  

Start a Redis server with either `redis-server` or Docker:  

```shell
redis-server &

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```


<h2>Prepare for deployment</h2>

The last step to deploy our component is preparing the declarative manifest in `wadm.yaml`, which defines the desired state for our application when it is running on wasmCloud. This will look familiar if you've used container orchestrators like Kubernetes. The manifest included with the `hello-world-tinygo` template looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: tinygo-http-hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "HTTP hello world demo in Golang (TinyGo), using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)"
    experimental: true
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-hello-world
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the actor
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        # Link the HTTP server, and inform it to listen on port 8080
        # on the local machine
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080

    # Add a capability provider that mediates HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver

```
The metadata fields provide naming and versioning for our application. We'll update the name to describe what we've built:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: tinygo-http-hello-world // [!code --]
  name: cruddy // [!code ++]
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "HTTP hello world demo in Golang (TinyGo), using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)" // [!code --]
	description: "CRUD demo" // [!code ++]
    experimental: true
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

You will also need to install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and run `npm install` in the project directory, since `wash` depends on npm to compile TypeScript/JavaScript code to Wasm. 

<h2>Creating a new component</h2>

In wasmCloud, an [**application component**](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) is a WebAssembly component dedicated to an application's creative logic. Typically, we will simply refer to this as a "component." Historically, wasmCloud referred to this piece of an application as an "actor," but that term is deprecated in favor of "component" and CLI commands will change as of v1.0.

With `wash` installed, you can run the following command in your shell to create a new component from a simple template: 

```shell
wash new actor cruddy --git wasmcloud/wasmcloud --subfolder examples/typescript/actors/http-hello-world --branch 0.82-examples
```

This command instructs `wash` to create a new component called "`cruddy`". For our template, we're using the `http-hello-world` template from the 0.82 branch of the wasmCloud project repo on GitHub. The `new actor` command always creates new components from templates&mdash;if you don't specify one from the outset, `wash` will provide you with a set of options.

The repo we're using gives us the skeleton for a new component in TypeScript. Let's take a look at the `cruddy` directory:

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── build
├── http-hello-world.ts
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── tsconfig.json
├── types
├── wadm.yaml
├── wasmcloud.toml
└── wit
```

Here we have an `http-hello-world.ts` file for the project, a `types` directory that we'll touch on more in a moment, and an empty `build` directory, along with standard files for a TypeScript project like `package.json`. We also have three pieces that make up a wasmCloud project:

* **`wadm.yaml`** is a declarative deployment manifest used by `wadm`. 
* **`wasmcloud.toml`** is a metadata and permissions configuration file for the application component.
* The **`wit`** directory holds **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** definitions for standard APIs used across the Wasm ecosystem&mdash;we'll discuss these at greater length in a moment.

Let's open `wasmcloud.toml` and have a look around:

```toml
name = "typescript-http-hello-world"
language = "typescript" 
type = "actor"
version = "0.1.0"

[actor]
wit_world = "hello"
wasm_target = "wasm32-wasi-preview2"

build_command = "npm run build"
build_artifact = "dist/http-hello-world.wasm"
destination = "build/http_hello_world_s.wasm"
```

Here we have metadata for details like naming and versioning. For now, we're most interested in the `[actor]` fields: 

* **`wit_world`** specifies the specific "world" of APIs defined in WIT that this application can use.
* **`wasm_target`** identifies the version of WebAssembly to use as a compilation target&mdash;in this case, WebAssembly with the Wasm System Interface (WASI) 0.2
* **`build_command`** defines the custom build command that we will use to build a TypeScript-based component
* **`build_artifact`** identifies the initial compiled Wasm binary for your build command.
* **`destination`** defines the name and location of the final, signed Wasm artifact for the component.

Now let's take a look at the `wit` directory.

<h2>Understanding WIT dependencies</h2>

We will interact with the `httpserver` and `keyvalue` capabilities via **WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)** APIs&mdash;ecosystem-standard APIs used for communication with and between components. 

:::info[Where does WASI fit in the development cycle?]
WASI is especially useful for building and maintaining standard and popular libraries in an efficient and language-agnostic way&mdash;so developers can focus on writing simple, portable, idiomatic code.
:::

Take a look at the contents of `wit`:

```
├── deps
├── deps.toml
└── world.wit
```
* `deps` is a directory that holds WIT definitions. 
* `deps.toml` is a TOML configuration file used to manage WIT dependencies.
* `world.wit` defines the interfaces that comprise your WIT "world."

Our template has pre-populated the `wit` directory with relevant definitions. However, if you wish to select your WIT dependencies and populate the directory yourself, you can use the [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) tool.

Open `deps.toml`. Here we have specified interfaces that we wish to utilize in our app. WASI interfaces like `wasi-http` or `wasi-keyvalue` are [available to browse in the WebAssembly project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md). 

WIT definitions contain documentation as comments within the WIT files themselves. It is very useful to read through the WIT comprehensively before using a new interface. 

Take a look at `/deps/http/types.wit`. Here you'll find a detailed explanation of the interface's types. Note the `outgoing-request` type&mdash;it will come up again in a moment.

```
/// Represents an outgoing HTTP Request.
resource outgoing-request 
```

With our WIT dependencies in place, we can specify interface imports and exports in `world.wit`. A **WIT world** is a set of standard interfaces that you can use to interact with components via defined functions and types. The WIT interfaces don't provide functionality in themselves&mdash;instead, they provide a common language for the *contracts* between components. 

Remember that we targeted the `hello` world in our `wasmcloud.toml` file; this is where that world is defined. Let's update the `hello` world in `world.wit`:

```
package wasmcloud:hello;

world hello {
  import wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0; // [!code ++]
  // [!code ++]
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

The `wasmcloud.toml` file points to the `hello` world in `world.wit`, and the `hello` world connects to our WIT definitions. 

Now that our dependencies are defined, we're ready to get coding.

<h2>Working with WASI APIs in your TypeScript code</h2>

Open `http-hello-world.ts`. 

```typescript
import {
  IncomingRequest,
  ResponseOutparam,
  OutgoingResponse,
  Fields,
} from "wasi:http/types@0.2.0";

// Implementation of wasi-http incoming-handler
//
// NOTE: To understand the types involved, take a look at wit/deps/http/types.wit
function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
  // Start building an outgoing response
  const outgoingResponse = new OutgoingResponse(new Fields());

  // Access the outgoing response body
  let outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body();
  // Create a stream for the response body
  let outputStream = outgoingBody.write();
  // // Write hello world to the response stream
  outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(
    new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode("Hello from Typescript!\n"))
  );

  // Set the status code for the response
  outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);

  // Set the created response
  ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
}

export const incomingHandler = {
  handle,
};
```
Most of this file is simple boilerplate. We'd like to use the WASI APIs that we've made available, but where can we learn how to *use* those APIs in TypeScript?

We can find documented TypeScript bindings for some of the WASI APIs defined by our WIT files in the `types` directory. Currently, the bindings correspond to the `hello` WIT world as it was defined in the template with only the HTTP export. Typically, we would update the bindings to reflect our changes to the WIT world by running a build.

```shell
wash build
```

:::info[Missing imports]

At the time of writing, the underlying JavaScript component-builder JCO does not generate types for `wasi:keyvalue`. TypeScript-based components using the `wasi:keyvalue` API still work, but understanding how to use the API can be a little more challenging. This is a known issue and will be resolved in a future JCO release. For now, you can tell the TypeScript compiler to ignore the missing types by adding `//@ts-expect-error` before each import statement. Simply including the import statement will allow the wasmCloud host to provide the functionality at runtime.

:::

_Note that the bindings are based on the imports and exports defined in your WIT world_. If you were to update the WIT world again, you would need to generate bindings again.

In our `types` directory we have a variety of bindings in `.d.ts` files. Open `types/wasi-http-types.d.ts`. You will find definitions of the bindings between HTTP types in your WIT world and their implementations in TypeScript. Take, for example, the `outgoing-response` type that we observed in `types.wit`. We can find the binding in `types/wasi-http-types.d.ts` on lines 280-287:

```typescript
  /**
   * Construct an `outgoing-response`, with a default `status-code` of `200`.
   * If a different `status-code` is needed, it must be set via the
   * `set-status-code` method.
   *
   * * `headers` is the HTTP Headers for the Response.
   */
  export { OutgoingResponse };
```

Taken in conjunction, our WIT files and our generated bindings give us the tools we need to use the API and put the pieces together. If you return to our root `http-hello-world.ts` project file, you'll notice that we're importing a variety of types from the `hello` world, including `OutgoingResponse`:

```typescript
import {
  IncomingRequest,
  ResponseOutparam,
  OutgoingResponse,
  Fields,
} from "wasi:http/types@0.2.0";
```

While we're here, let's import some more types that we will need later on. Note that we've added `//@ts-expect-error` before our `wasi:keyvalue` import statements per the warning above. (Also note that we're renaming `wasi:keyvalue`'s `delete` function to `eightysix`, since the compiler doesn't like having a function named `delete`.) 

```typescript
import {
  IncomingRequest,
  ResponseOutparam,
  OutgoingResponse,
  Fields,
  Method // [!code ++]
} from "wasi:http/types@0.2.0";

//@ts-expect-error -- bindings not currently generated by JCO // [!code ++:5]
import { Bucket, OutgoingValue, IncomingValue } from 'wasi:keyvalue/types@0.1.0';

//@ts-expect-error -- bindings not currently generated by JCO 
import { set, get, delete as eightysix } from 'wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0';
```
Now let's look at the rest of the file. First, the `handle` function handles an incoming `req` (of the `IncomingRequest` type) and return a `resp` (of the `ResponseOutparam` type). Most of our app will take place within this function.

```typescript
function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) 
```

Next we have the code for sending HTTP responses. Let's go ahead and delete that, since we'll be replacing it soon.

```typescript
  // Start building an outgoing response // [!code --:17]
  const outgoingResponse = new OutgoingResponse(new Fields());

  // Access the outgoing response body
  let outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body();
  // Create a stream for the response body
  let outputStream = outgoingBody.write();
  // // Write hello world to the response stream
  outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(
    new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode("Hello from Typescript!\n"))
  );

  // Set the status code for the response
  outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);

  // Set the created response
  ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
```

Now, below the `handle` function and above the `export` for `incomingHandler`, add a new function called `getNameFromPath`&mdash;much like in the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world). This will extract and return a name provided in incoming HTTP queries. 

```typescript
function getNameFromPath(path: string): string { 
  const parts = path.split("=");
  if (parts.length == 2) {
    return parts[1];
  }
  return `Anonymous`;
}
```

Call `getNameFromPath` at the top of the `handle` function. We'll use the `pathWithQuery()` method from the WASI HTTP API on `req` to grab the path and query from the incoming request:

```typescript
// Get the name // [!code ++:2]
const name = getNameFromPath(req.pathWithQuery() || "");
```

This is the first time we're actually implementing a new WASI method in this component, so we should pause to consider exactly what we're doing: 

* `req` is defined as the `IncomingRequest` type at the top of the function.
* When we look at our WIT bindings, we can see that `IncomingRequest` has a method `pathWithQuery()`. 

In order to guide our CRUD operations for the guestbook, we'd also like to know the **method** of the incoming request. We can detect that with the API as well. Try finding the method of the request with what you've learned so far.

If you guessed that you could use a method on `req` again, well done! Below the previous line add:

```typescript
// Find the request method // [!code ++:3]
const checkMethod: Method = req.method();
const method = checkMethod.tag;
```

The `method()` method uses the `Method` type. If we consult the `wasi-http-types.d.ts` WIT bindings, starting on line 373 we see how to interact with our method types. Using `.tag` will give us the method as a string&mdash;for example, ``get``.

We've implemented our basic HTTP operations. Now let's turn to key-value storage.  

<h2>Adding CRUD</h2> 

Typically, we would follow the same procedure we used for `wasi-http` to explore the `wasi-keyvalue` API and start adding CRUD operations. This is the procedure we use in our other language walkthroughs, but because JCO doesn't currently generate bindings for `keyvalue`, we have to be a little more creative.   

In `/wit/deps/keyvalue/types.wit`, we see that collections of key-value pairs are referenced as `buckets` in the API:

```
	/// A bucket is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is stored
	/// as a entry in the bucket, and the bucket itself acts as a collection of all
	/// these entries.
	///
	/// It is worth noting that the exact terminology for bucket in key-value stores
	/// can very depending on the specific implementation. For example,
	/// 1. Amazon DynamoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a table
	/// 2. Redis has hashes, sets, and sorted sets as different types of collections
	/// 3. Cassandra calls a collection of key-value pairs a column family
	/// 4. MongoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a collection
	/// 5. Riak calls a collection of key-value pairs a bucket
	/// 6. Memcached calls a collection of key-value pairs a slab
	/// 7. Azure Cosmos DB calls a collection of key-value pairs a container
	///
	/// In this interface, we use the term `bucket` to refer to a collection of key-value
```
If you make an import error when building with JCO, you get a list of available imports, an excerpt of which we'll list here as a useful reference:

```
[static]bucket.openBucket, [static]outgoingValue.newOutgoingValue, [method]outgoingValue.outgoingValueWriteBodyAsync, [method]outgoingValue.outgoingValueWriteBodySync, [static]incomingValue.incomingValueConsumeSync, [static]incomingValue.incomingValueConsumeAsync, [method]incomingValue.incomingValueSize, [resourceDrop]bucket, [resourceDrop]outgoingValue, [resourceDrop]incomingValue
```

Hey, there's our `Bucket` with its `openBucket` method! You might recall that we already imported the `Bucket` type. Add the following below the `method` detection:

```typescript
// Open the bucket // [!code ++:2]
const bucket = Bucket.openBucket('');
```
Next we'll create a variable called `value` that will hold the new values assigned to keys in PUT/set operations. This is a `wasi-keyvalue` pattern that we would use in any language: the `newOutgoingValue()` method is creating a new resource, which we can use to perform synchronous write operations. 

```typescript
// Create new outgoing value resource // [!code ++:2]
const value = OutgoingValue.newOutgoingValue();
```

Now we'll replace our existing response with a switch case that **creates/updates**, **reads**, or **destroys** guestbook records based on the HTTP method of the incoming request. For this rudimentary app, each case will send an appropriate HTTP response:

```typescript
switch (method) { // [!code ++:49]
    case `get`:
      const result = get(bucket, name);
      if (result === undefined) {
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Not found\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      } else {
        // Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get bytes, which we will then send as part of http response
        const incoming = IncomingValue.incomingValueConsumeSync(result);
        // Send the HTTP response. We don't need to do anything to the incoming value -- it's already the expected bytes.
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(incoming);
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      }
    case `put`:
      // Write the actual value to the value resource
      value.outgoingValueWriteBodySync(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`attended`)));
      // Set it and forget it
      set(bucket, name, value);
      // Write and send the HTTP response
      outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Added ${name}!\n`)));
      outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
      ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
      return;
    case `delete`:
      const delcheck = get(bucket, name);
      if (delcheck === undefined) {
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`${name} not found\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      } else {
        // Delete the key
        eightysix(bucket, name);
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`It's like ${name} was never there\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      }
    default: 
      // Write hello world to the response stream, set the status code, and set response
      outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Try a GET, PUT, or DELETE\n`)));
      outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
      ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
      return;
  }
```

Most of our application logic is happening in this block, so let's pause to consider a few important elements. 

The condition for each case is the request method returned to the `method` const. Within the cases, each CRUD operation runs as an imported function (`get`, `set`, or `eightysix`-formerly-known-as-`delete`) against `bucket` and `name`. 

For the `set`, we use the `outgoingValueWriteBodySync()` method to write the body of the value to `value`. The value must be written as bytes. With our value written to `value`, we can pass it to `set`.

The `get` logic is similar but runs in reverse. `get` gives us a result that must be consumed with `incomingValueConsumeSync`, which gives us a byte result, which can be passed directly to the HTTP response.

At this point, `http-hello-world.ts` should look like this:

```typescript
import {
  IncomingRequest,
  ResponseOutparam,
  OutgoingResponse,
  Fields,
  Method
} from "wasi:http/types@0.2.0";

//@ts-expect-error -- bindings not currently generated by JCO
import { Bucket, OutgoingValue, IncomingValue } from 'wasi:keyvalue/types@0.1.0';

//@ts-expect-error -- bindings not currently generated by JCO 
import { set, get, delete as eightysix } from 'wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0';

function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {

  // Prepare an outgoing response
  const outgoingResponse = new OutgoingResponse(new Fields());
  const outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body();
  const outputStream = outgoingBody.write();

  // Get the name
  const name = getNameFromPath(req.pathWithQuery() || ""); 

  // Find the request method
  const checkMethod: Method = req.method();
  const method = checkMethod.tag;

  // Open the bucket
  const bucket = Bucket.openBucket('');

  // Create new outgoing value resource
  const value = OutgoingValue.newOutgoingValue();

  switch (method) {
    case `get`:
      const result = get(bucket, name);
      if (result === undefined) {
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Not found\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      } else {
        // Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get bytes, which we will then send as part of http response
        const incoming = IncomingValue.incomingValueConsumeSync(result);
        // Send the HTTP response. We don't need to do anything to the incoming value -- it's already the expected bytes.
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(incoming);
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      }
    case `put`:
      // Write the actual value to the value resource
      value.outgoingValueWriteBodySync(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`attended`)));
      // Set it and forget it
      set(bucket, name, value);
      // Write and send the HTTP response
      outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Added ${name}!\n`)));
      outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
      ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
      return;
    case `delete`:
      const delcheck = get(bucket, name);
      if (delcheck === undefined) {
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`${name} not found\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      } else {
        // Delete the key
        eightysix(bucket, name);
        outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`It's like ${name} was never there\n`)));
        outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
        ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
        return;
      }
    default: 
      // Write hello world to the response stream, set the status code, and set response
      outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(`Try a GET, PUT, or DELETE\n`)));
      outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
      ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: "ok", val: outgoingResponse });
      return;
  }
}

function getNameFromPath(path: string): string { 
  const parts = path.split("=");
  if (parts.length == 2) {
    return parts[1];
  }
  return `Anonymous`;
}

export const incomingHandler = {
  handle,
};

```

Since we've made changes to `http-hello-world.ts`, we'll build again to update the `.wasm` artifact:  

```shell
wash build
```

<h2>Start Redis</h2>

Up front, we said that we don't have to worry about the underlying software that *provides* a capability until we deploy. Now it's time to start thinking about which **capability providers** we want to use. You can explore the [list of available capability providers](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers) in the wasmCloud GitHub repo. For key-value storage, we'll use Redis.  

Start a Redis server with either `redis-server` or Docker:  

```shell
redis-server &

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```


<h2>Prepare for deployment</h2>

The last step to deploy our component is preparing the declarative manifest in `wadm.yaml`, which defines the desired state for our application when it is running on wasmCloud. This will look familiar if you've used container orchestrators like Kubernetes. The manifest included with the TypeScript template looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: typescript-http-hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "Demo of Typescript HTTP hello world server"
    experimental: true
spec:
  components:
    # (Capability Provider) mediates HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver

    # (Actor) A test actor that returns a string for any given HTTP request
    - name: typescript-http-hello-world
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the actor
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1

        # Link the HTTP server, and inform it to listen on port 8080
        # on the local machine
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080
```
The metadata fields provide naming and versioning for our application. We'll update the name to describe what we've built:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: typescript-http-hello-world # [!code --]
  name: cruddy # [!code ++]
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "Demo of Typescript HTTP hello world server" # [!code --]
	description: "CRUD demo" # [!code ++]
    experimental: true
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

You will also need both [Python 3.10 or later](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). After you have those, you'll need to install [componentize-py v0.12 or later](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started), since `wash` depends on `componentize-py` to compile Python code to Wasm. 

<h2>Creating a new component</h2>

In wasmCloud, an [**application component**](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) is a WebAssembly component dedicated to an application's creative logic. Typically, we will simply refer to this as a "component." Historically, wasmCloud referred to this piece of an application as an "actor," but that term is deprecated in favor of "component" and CLI commands will change as of v1.0.

With `wash` installed, you can run the following command in your shell to create a new component from a simple template: 

```shell
wash new actor cruddy-py --git wasmcloud/wasmcloud --subfolder examples/python/actors/http-hello-world --branch 0.82-examples

```

This command instructs `wash` to create a new component called "`cruddy-py`". For our template, we're using the `http-hello-world` template from the 0.82 branch of the wasmCloud project repo on GitHub. The `new actor` command always creates new components from templates&mdash;if you don't specify one from the outset, `wash` will provide you with a set of options.

The repo we're using gives us the skeleton for a new actor in Python. Let's take a look at the `cruddy-py` directory:

```shell
├── app.py
├── build
├── wadm.yaml
├── wasmcloud.toml
└── wit
```

Here we have an `app.py` file for the project and an empty `build` directory. We also have three pieces that make up a wasmCloud project:

* **`wadm.yaml`** is a declarative deployment manifest used by `wadm`. 
* **`wasmcloud.toml`** is a metadata and permissions configuration file for the application component.
* The **`wit`** directory holds **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** definitions for standard APIs used across the Wasm ecosystem&mdash;we'll discuss these at greater length in a moment.

Let's open `wasmcloud.toml` and have a look around:

```toml
name = "python-http-hello-world"
language = "python" 
type = "component"
version = "0.1.0"

[component]
build_command = "componentize-py -d ./wit -w hello componentize app -o build/http_hello_world.wasm"
build_artifact = "build/http_hello_world.wasm"
destination = "build/http_hello_world_s.wasm"
```

Here we have metadata for details like naming and versioning. For now, we're most interested in the three `[component]` fields: 

* **`build_command`** defines the custom build command that we will use to build a Python-based component using `componentize-py`
* **`build_artifact`** identifies the initial compiled Wasm binary for your build command.
* **`destination`** defines the name and location of the final, signed Wasm artifact for the component.

Now let's take a look at the `wit` directory.

<h2>Understanding WIT dependencies</h2>

We will interact with the `httpserver` and `keyvalue` capabilities via **WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)** APIs&mdash;ecosystem-standard APIs used for communication with and between components. 

:::info[Where does WASI fit in the development cycle?]
WASI is especially useful for building and maintaining standard and popular libraries in an efficient and language-agnostic way&mdash;so developers can focus on writing simple, portable, idiomatic code.
:::

Take a look at the contents of `wit`:

```
├── deps
├── deps.toml
└── world.wit
```
* `deps` is a directory that holds WIT definitions. 
* `deps.toml` is a TOML configuration file used to manage WIT dependencies.
* `world.wit` defines the interfaces that comprise your WIT "world."

Our template has pre-populated the `wit` directory with relevant definitions. However, if you wish to select your WIT dependencies and populate the directory yourself, you can use the [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) tool.

Open `deps.toml`. Here we have specified interfaces that we wish to utilize in our app. WASI interfaces like `wasi-http` or `wasi-keyvalue` are [available to browse in the WebAssembly project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md). 

WIT definitions contain documentation as comments within the WIT files themselves. It is very useful to read through the WIT comprehensively before using a new interface. 

Take a look at `/deps/http/types.wit`. Here you'll find a detailed explanation of the interface's types. Note the `outgoing-request` type&mdash;it will come up again in a moment.

```
/// Represents an outgoing HTTP Request.
resource outgoing-request 
```

With our WIT dependencies in place, we can specify interface imports and exports in `world.wit`. A **WIT world** is a set of standard interfaces that you can use to interact with components via defined functions and types. The WIT interfaces don't provide functionality in themselves&mdash;instead, they provide a common language for the *contracts* between components. 

Remember that we targeted the `hello` world in our `wasmcloud.toml` file; this is where that world is defined.  Let's update the `hello` world in `world.wit`:

```
package wasmcloud:hello;

world hello {
  import wasi:keyvalue/atomic@0.1.0; // [!code ++]
  import wasi:keyvalue/eventual@0.1.0; // [!code ++]
  import wasi:logging/logging; // [!code ++]
  // [!code ++]
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

The `wasmcloud.toml` file points to the `hello` world in `world.wit`, and the `hello` world connects to our WIT definitions. 

Now that our dependencies are defined, we're ready to get coding.

<h2>Working with WASI APIs in your Python code</h2>

Open `app.py`. 

```python
from hello import exports
from hello.types import Ok
from hello.imports.types import (
    IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam,
    OutgoingResponse, Fields, OutgoingBody
)

class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):
    def handle(self, _: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
        # Construct the HTTP response to send back 
        outgoingResponse = OutgoingResponse(Fields.from_list([]))
        # Set the status code to OK
        outgoingResponse.set_status_code(200)
        outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body()
        # Write our Hello World message to the response body
        outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("Hello from Python!\n", "utf-8"))
        OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
        # Set and send the HTTP response
        ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))
```
Most of this file is simple boilerplate. We'd like to use the WASI APIs that we've made available, but where can we learn how to *use* those APIs in Python?

`componentize-py` makes it easy to generate documented Python bindings for the WASI APIs defined by our WIT files. This will also enable IDE suggestions and autofills, providing a smoother development experience. To generate the bindings:

```shell
componentize-py bindings .
```

_Note that the bindings will be based on the imports and exports defined in your WIT world_. If you were to update the WIT world again, you would need to generate bindings again.

Now you have a new `hello` directory with bindings in `.py` files. Open `hello/imports/types.py`. You will find definitions of the bindings between types in your WIT world and their implementations in Python. Take, for example, the `outgoing-response` type that we observed in `types.wit`. We can find the binding in `hello/imports/types.py` (Try searching the file for "OutgoingResponse"):

```python
class OutgoingResponse:
    """
    Represents an outgoing HTTP Response.
    """
        
    def __init__(self, headers: Fields):
        """
        Construct an `outgoing-response`, with a default `status-code` of `200`.
        If a different `status-code` is needed, it must be set via the
        `set-status-code` method.
        
        * `headers` is the HTTP Headers for the Response.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError

    def status_code(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the HTTP Status Code for the Response.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError

    def set_status_code(self, status_code: int) -> None:
        """
        Set the HTTP Status Code for the Response. Fails if the status-code
        given is not a valid http status code.
        
        Raises: `hello.types.Err(None)`
        """
        raise NotImplementedError
```

Taken in conjunction, our WIT files and our generated bindings give us the tools we need to use the API and put the pieces together. If you return to our root `app.py` project file, you'll notice that we're importing a variety of types from the `hello` world, including `OutgoingResponse`:

```python
from hello.imports.types import (
    IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam,
    OutgoingResponse, Fields, OutgoingBody
)
```

While we're here, let's import some more types and some key-value functions that we will need later on:

```python
from hello.imports.types import (
    IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam,
    OutgoingResponse, Fields, OutgoingBody, 
    Bucket, OutgoingValue, IncomingValue, MethodGet, MethodPut, MethodDelete # [!code ++]
)
from hello.imports.eventual import (set, get, delete) # [!code ++]
```
Now let's look at the rest of the file. First, an `IncomingHandler` is instantiated with a `handle` function inside set to handle an incoming `request` (of the `IncomingRequest` type) and return a `response` (of the `ResponseOutparam` type). Most of our app will take place within this function.

```python
class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):
    def handle(self, _: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
```

Next we have the code for sending HTTP responses. Let's go ahead and delete that, since we'll be replacing it soon.

```python
# Construct the HTTP response to send back # [!code --]
outgoingResponse = OutgoingResponse(Fields.from_list([])) # [!code --]
# Set the status code to OK # [!code --]
outgoingResponse.set_status_code(200) # [!code --]
outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body() # [!code --]
# Write our Hello World message to the response body # [!code --]
outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("Hello from Python!\n", "utf-8")) # [!code --]
OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None) # [!code --]
# Set and send the HTTP response # [!code --]
ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse)) # [!code --]
```

Now, outside and below the `IncomingHandler` object, add a new function called `getName`&mdash;much like in the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world). This will extract and return a name provided in incoming HTTP queries. 

```python
# Helper function to get name # [!code ++]
def get_name_from_path(path: str) -> str: # [!code ++]
    parts = path.split("=") # [!code ++]
    if len(parts) == 2: # [!code ++]
        return parts[-1] # [!code ++]
    else: # [!code ++]
        return "Anonymous" # [!code ++]

```

Call `get_name_from_path` at the top of the handler function. We'll use the `path_with_query()` method from the WASI HTTP API to grab the path and query from the incoming request:

```python
# Get the name # [!code ++]
name = get_name_from_path(request.path_with_query()) # [!code ++]
```

This is the first time we're actually implementing a new WASI method in this component, so we should pause to consider exactly what we're doing: 

* `request` is defined as the `IncomingRequest` type at the top of the function.
* When we look at our WIT bindings, we can see that `IncomingRequest` has a method `path_with_query()`. (Our IDE autofill can surface the method even more easily.) 

In order to guide our CRUD operations for the guestbook, we'd also like to know the method of the incoming request. We can detect that with the API as well. Try finding the method of the request with what you've learned so far.

If you guessed that you could use a method on `request` again, well done! Below the previous line add:

```python
# Detect request method # [!code ++]
method = request.method() # [!code ++]
```

This will return a method of one of the types we imported earlier (`MethodGet`, `MethodPut`, or `MethodDelete`).

We've implemented our basic HTTP operations. Now let's turn to key-value storage.  

<h2>Adding CRUD</h2> 

We can follow the same procedure we used for `wasi-http` to explore the wasi-keyvalue API and start adding CRUD operations.  

In `/wit/deps/keyvalue/types.wit`, we see that collections of key-value pairs are referenced as `buckets` in the API:

```wit
	/// A bucket is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is stored
	/// as a entry in the bucket, and the bucket itself acts as a collection of all
	/// these entries.
	///
	/// It is worth noting that the exact terminology for bucket in key-value stores
	/// can very depending on the specific implementation. For example,
	/// 1. Amazon DynamoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a table
	/// 2. Redis has hashes, sets, and sorted sets as different types of collections
	/// 3. Cassandra calls a collection of key-value pairs a column family
	/// 4. MongoDB calls a collection of key-value pairs a collection
	/// 5. Riak calls a collection of key-value pairs a bucket
	/// 6. Memcached calls a collection of key-value pairs a slab
	/// 7. Azure Cosmos DB calls a collection of key-value pairs a container
	///
	/// In this interface, we use the term `bucket` to refer to a collection of key-value
```
Peruse the `/hello/imports/types.py` file to explore the Python bindings. (Searching `bucket` in the file is a quick way to find the relevant details.) You might also recall that we imported the `Bucket` type. The syntax to open a bucket is pretty intuitive&mdash;add the following below the `method` detection:

```python
# Open the bucket # [!code ++]
bucket = Bucket.open_bucket("") # [!code ++]
```
Next we'll create a variable called `value` that will hold the new values assigned to keys in PUT/set operations. This is a `wasi-keyvalue` pattern that we would use in any language: the `new_outgoing_value()` method is creating a new resource, which we can use to perform synchronous write operations. 

```python
# Create new outgoing value resource, then write the actual value # [!code ++]
value = OutgoingValue.new_outgoing_value() # [!code ++]
```

Now we'll replace our existing response with a conditional sequence that **creates/updates**, **reads**, or **destroys** guestbook records based on the HTTP method of the incoming request. For this rudimentary app, each case will send an appropriate HTTP response:

```python
# Begin conditional sequence on method # [!code ++]
        if type(method) == MethodGet: # [!code ++]
            # [!code ++]
            # Get the value for this key (will return None if not found) # [!code ++]
            result = get(bucket, name) # [!code ++]
            # [!code ++]
            # Checking for noneness to handle errors # [!code ++]
            if result == None: # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]
                # Send error message if the value is none # [!code ++]
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("{} not found\n".format(name), "utf-8")) # [!code ++]
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None) # [!code ++]
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse)) # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]
            else: # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]
                # Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get a byte array, which we will then send as part of http response # [!code ++]
                incoming = IncomingValue.incoming_value_consume_sync(result) # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]
                # Send the HTTP response. We don't need to do anything to the incoming value -- it's already the expected byte array. # [!code ++]
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(incoming) # [!code ++]
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None) # [!code ++]
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse)) # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]
        elif type(method) == MethodPut: # [!code ++]
# [!code ++]

            ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse)) # [!code ++]
```

Most of our application logic is happening in this block, so let's pause to consider a few important elements. 

The condition for each case is the request method returned to the `method` variable as a type. Within the conditionals, each CRUD operation runs as an imported function (`get`, `set`, or `delete`) against `bucket` and `name`. In the case of `delete`, that's extremely straightforward, since no data is being passed. The `set` and `get` operations are just a touch more complicated. 

For the `set`, we use the `outgoing_value_write_body_sync()` method to write the body of the value to `value`. The value must be written as bytes. With our value written to `value`, we can pass it to `set`.

The `get` logic is similar but runs in reverse. `get` gives us a result that must be consumed with `incoming_value_consume_sync`, which gives us a byte result, which can be passed directly to the HTTP response.

At this point, `app.py` should look like this:

```python
from hello import exports
from hello.types import Ok
from hello.imports.types import (
    IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam,
    OutgoingResponse, Fields, OutgoingBody, Bucket, 
    OutgoingValue, IncomingValue, MethodGet, MethodPut, MethodDelete
)
from hello.imports.eventual import (set, get, delete)

class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):

    def handle(self, request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
        
        # Construct the HTTP response to send back 
        outgoingResponse = OutgoingResponse(Fields.from_list([]))
        outgoingResponse.set_status_code(200)
        outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body()
        
        # Get the name
        name = get_name_from_path(request.path_with_query()) 
        
        # Detect request method
        method = request.method()

        # Open the bucket
        bucket = Bucket.open_bucket("")

        # Create new outgoing value resource
        value = OutgoingValue.new_outgoing_value()

        # Begin conditional sequence on method
        if type(method) == MethodGet:
            
            # Get the value for this key (will return None if not found)
            result = get(bucket, name)
            
            # Checking for noneness to handle errors
            if result == None:

                # Send error message if the value is none
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("{} not found\n".format(name), "utf-8")) 
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))

            else:

                # Take this result (of the IncomingValue type) and consume that value to get bytes, which we will then send as part of http response
                incoming = IncomingValue.incoming_value_consume_sync(result)

                # Send the HTTP response. We don't need to do anything to the incoming value -- it's already the expected bytes.
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(incoming) 
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))

        elif type(method) == MethodPut:

            # Write the actual value to the value resource
            value.outgoing_value_write_body_sync(bytes("attended\n", "utf-8"))
        
            # Set it and forget it
            set(bucket, name, value)

            # Write and send the HTTP response
            outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("Added {}!\n".format(name), "utf-8")) 
            OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
            ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))

        elif type(method) == MethodDelete:
            
            # Get the value for this key (will return None if not found)
            result = get(bucket, name)
            
            # Checking for noneness to handle errors
            if result == None:

                # Send error message if the value is none
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("{} not found\n".format(name), "utf-8")) 
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))

            else:

                # Delete the key
                delete(bucket, name)
            
                # Write and send the HTTP response
                outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("It's like {} was never there\n".format(name), "utf-8")) 
                OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
                ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))

    parts = path.split("=")
    if len(parts) == 2:

    else:
        return "Anonymous"

```

Since we've made changes to `app.py`, we'll build again to update the `.wasm` artifact:  

```shell
wash build
```

<h2>Start Redis</h2>

Up front, we said that we don't have to worry about the underlying software that *provides* a capability until we deploy. Now it's time to start thinking about which **capability providers** we want to use. You can explore the [list of available capability providers](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers) in the wasmCloud GitHub repo. For key-value storage, we'll use Redis.  

Start a Redis server with either `redis-server` or Docker:  

```shell
redis-server &

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

<h2>Prepare for deployment</h2>

The last step to deploy our component is preparing the declarative manifest in `wadm.yaml`, which defines the desired state for our application when it is running on wasmCloud. This will look familiar if you've used container orchestrators like Kubernetes. The manifest included with the `hello-world-python` template looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: python-http-hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: 'Python component that uses wasi:http'
    experimental: true
spec:
  components:
    - name: python-http
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the actor
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        # Link the HTTP server, and inform it to listen on port 8081
        # on the local machine
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080

    # Add a capability providers that mediates HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver

```
The metadata fields provide naming and versioning for our application. We'll update the name to describe what we've built:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: python-http-hello-world // [!code --]
  name: cruddy // [!code ++]
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: 'Python component that uses wasi:http' // [!code --]
	description: "CRUD demo" // [!code ++]
    experimental: true
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info[Note]
Every time we publish a new version, we'll need to increment (or otherwise change) the **`version`** annotation here.
:::  

Next in the spec, we have our components: the `http-hello-world` templated component that we've been working on, and the `httpserver` capability fulfilled by a capability provider. We'll explore capabilities more in a moment, but first, we'll give the component a **link** to the `keyvalue` capability, specifying the address for the Redis service: 

```yaml
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-hello-world
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080
        - type: linkdef # [!code ++]
          properties: # [!code ++]
            target: keyvalue # [!code ++]
            values: # [!code ++]
              address: redis://127.0.0.1:6379 # [!code ++]
```

Finally, we'll add the `keyvalue` capability provider as the final component that makes up our application. As part of this entry, we'll specify that the component&mdash;provided through the defined image&mdash;is **fulfilling the contract** for the keyvalue capability. wasmCloud operates on a zero-trust security model: without being explicitly linked to a capability, the application component would have no access to it.

```yaml
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
    - name: keyvalue # [!code ++]
      type: capability # [!code ++]
      properties: # [!code ++]
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/kvredis:0.22.0 # [!code ++]
        contract: wasmcloud:keyvalue # [!code ++]
```

We effectively promised our application component that *someone* would get the job done, and now these first-party providers (developed as part of the wasmCloud project) are stepping up to fill the role. A different provider&mdash;first-party, third-party, or of original design&mdash;could just as easily do the same. The same component we wrote could perform CRUDdy operations against any number of different key-value stores&mdash;etcd, MongoDB, Cassandra, or your own&mdash;as long as a provider exists for it. If a provider doesn't exist yet, you have [all the tools you need to create one](/docs/developer/providers/).  

Once you put all of the pieces of `wadm.yaml` together, the file should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: cruddy
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: 'CRUD demo'
    experimental: true
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-hello-world
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: keyvalue
            values:
              address: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
    - name: keyvalue
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/kvredis:0.22.0
        contract: wasmcloud:keyvalue
```

## Launch and iterate

Start a wasmCloud host with `wash up`. Now we're ready to launch our app:

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

To view your wasmCloud apps and check status:

```shell
wash app list
```

Once the app status is `Deployed`, we can test a PUT against our app with `curl`:

```shell
curl -X PUT "localhost:8080?name=Alice"
```

We should get the result:

```shell
Added Alice
```

We can test a GET and DELETE as well:

```shell
curl "localhost:8080?name=Alice"
attended
curl -X DELETE "localhost:8080?name=Alice"
It's like Alice was never there
```

If we want to update our application, we can `wash build`, update the version in `wadm.yaml`, and `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` again. 

Note that wasmCloud includes an experimental feature for dev loop iteration. Rather than `wash app deploy`, from your project directory you can run:

```shell
wash dev --experimental --host-id=<your-host-id> 
```

This will start a dev deployment that continuously watches for changes to the `.wasm` file for your component. If you would like to try this experimental feature, first clean up your existing deployment according to the instructions below.

## Clean up

Once you're finished working with these tutorial materials, undeploy the application to stop it from running on the wasmCloud host and delete active links, freeing up associated ports:

```shell
wash app undeploy cruddy
```

To completely remove all versions of the application from wasmCloud:

```shell
wash app delete cruddy --delete-all
```
## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to create a guestbook application component that uses WASI APIs including HTTP and Key-Value. In doing so, you've also learned how to read the WIT definitions for those APIs and utilize idiomatic bindings for our chosen language. With these fundamentals in place, a good next step might be to try building more complex components, [explore other WASI APIs](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md), or create your own interfaces and providers. If you have questions or feedback, join the [wasmCloud Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/) and let us know. Happy coding!
