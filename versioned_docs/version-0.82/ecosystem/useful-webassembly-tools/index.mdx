Beyond the wasmCloud toolchain, the WebAssembly community maintains many open source projects that are invaluable for Wasm users. This is a non-comprehensive list of tools we've found particularly useful.

## WIT syntax highlighting (VSCode)

Syntax highlighting can make WIT definitions easier to read. The [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/vscode-wit/) maintained by the Bytecode Alliance brings a more legible WIT experience to your IDE.

You can install via the extensions marketplace or manually. For a manual install, you will need [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/vscode-wit.git && cd vscode-wit
```

```shell
npm ci && npm run install-plugin
```

## WIT dependency management with `wit-deps`

It's important to ensure consistency between the WIT dependencies defined in your `deps.toml` manifest and the actual files in your project. [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) is a simple dependency management CLI tool maintained by the Bytecode Alliance that ensures your dependencies are consistently and correctly populated.

You will need [Rust and `cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Install `wit-deps` by running:

```shell
cargo install wit-deps-cli
```

Run `wit-deps` from the root of a wasmCloud project directory (one level above `wit`) to populate the `deps` directory with the definitions specified in `deps.toml` and create a `deps.lock` file:

```shell
wit-deps
```

For more detail on `wit-deps`, see the [documentation in the project README](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps).

## WebAssembly artifact manipulation with `wasm-tools`

Sometimes you might want to observe or manipulate a component independently of wasmCloud&mdash;perhaps to view the component's WIT interface, compose Wasm components into one, or even for more niche jobs like converting a WebAssembly module to a component. The [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) CLI tool is a utility belt with a long list of options.

You will need [Rust and `cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Install `wasm-tools` by running:

```shell
cargo install wasm-tools
```

## A standalone WebAssembly runtime: Wasmtime

[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is the WebAssembly runtime used by the wasmCloud host. If you'd like to test a component against standalone Wasmtime or explore runtime features, you can also install Wasmtime locally and use it to run components.

To install on Linux or macOs run:

```shell
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

## Virtualize components with WASI Virt

[WASI Virt](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt) allows you to encapsulate a virtualized component within another component. This is particularly useful when you want to use potentially sensitive WASI APIs such as Sockets and Filesystem but don't want to give them access to core operating system interfaces.

WASI Virt requires the nightly release channel for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Install the `wasi-virt` command line tool with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt
```
