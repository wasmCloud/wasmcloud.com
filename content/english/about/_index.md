  title : "Our mission is to <strong>revolutionize</strong> the way developers to build, operate, and mantain microservices.</strong>"
  image : "images/about/microservices-clipart.png"
  content : "Wasmcloud is a revolutionary approach to development leveraging an actor model, pluggable capabilities, a built-in interconnected lattice, and WebAssembly to deliver a simple, boilerplate free developer experience."
  bulletpoints:
  - "A stateless, immutable development model enables both dynamic and horizontal on-demand scaling."
  - "Incredibly secure.  Wasm's sandboxed, deny-by-default capability model is enhanced through cryptographically enhanced provenance chains."
  - "Performant and portable execution with your choice of either JIT'd or interpreted WebAssembly runtimes."
  - "Lattice - a self-forming, self-healing mesh network provides a unified, flattened topology across any number of disparate environments, clouds, browsers, or hardware."
