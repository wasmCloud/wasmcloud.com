The wasmCloud documentation site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com) and built with [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/).

Choosing a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is a great way to get started. 

## Running the site locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. It's a good idea build in order to check for errors like broken links that may prevent a successful deployment. 

## Serving static content

To serve the generated static content:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Diagram assets

You can find image assets for diagrams on the [community wasmCloud room in Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=iHIzqpeDMnzn3Wq78Qwv8,8cEWBZDy2DIlUGGzf2rWHg). 

We recommend copying assets that you would like to use to your own Excalidraw session and exporting your image as a PNG file with a transparent background (and careful use of black and white) for maximum compatibility with the documentation site's dark and light modes.

wasmCloud's brand colors are:

- Green Aqua - #00C389
- Light Gray - #768692
- Yellow - #FFB600
- Space Blue - #002E5D
- Gunmetal - #253746
- Gainsboro - #D9E1E2

## Generating CLI documentation

The [command-line documentation](/docs/cli/wash) at [`docs/cli/wash.mdx`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/tree/main/docs/cli/wash.mdx) is generated using the `--help-markdown` argument with `wash`. An easy way to run the command is `wash app list --help-markdown > wash-help.md`. Once you've generated CLI documentation, copy the contents to the `wash.mdx` file linked above.

The [command-line reference for the wasmCloud host](/docs/cli/wasmcloud) at [`docs/cli/wasmcloud.mdx`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/blob/main/docs/cli/wasmcloud.mdx) is generated in a similar way. You can clone [the `wasmcloud` repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/) and run `cargo run -- --help-markdown`. Once you've generated CLI documentation, copy the output to the `wasmcloud.mdx` file linked above. Take care to note instructions in the comments for this Markdown file.
