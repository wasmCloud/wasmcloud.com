**_wash_** (the _wasmCloud Shell_) is a single command-line interface (CLI) to handle all of your wasmCloud tooling needs. This CLI has a number of sub-commands that help you interact with the wasmCloud ecosystem.

```
wash --help
```

`wash` has built-in help and you can follow any subcommand with `--help` to get more information about options available. For example `wash --help`, `wash ctl --help`, `wash ctl start --help`, and `wash ctl start actor --help` all provide contextual help.

## Installation

`wash` can be installed from a binary release, or with cargo. See [installation](/docs/installation) for details.
