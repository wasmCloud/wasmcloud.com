Using wadm typically involves using the `wash` command line tool. However, you can also use wash's supporting library in your Rust application or interact with wadm directly over a NATS connection.

The following page on wadm API usage is an overview of the high-level functionality exposed by wadm. To see the corresponding commands in the `wash` CLI, issue the following command:

```shell
wash app --help
```

Please refer the [CLI reference](/docs/cli/wash#wash-app) of `wash app` for a detailed usage guide.
