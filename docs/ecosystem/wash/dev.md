`wash dev` is a subcommand that makes it easy to iteratively develop wasmCloud projects.

Thanks to the unique features of WebAssembly, WIT, and wasmCloud `wash dev` enables quick development feedback loops by:

- Building your project
- Starting a local wasmCloud host
- Resolving and running local versions of dependencies like providers where possible
- Deploying your application
- Reloading (and redeploying) your application on local code changes.

## `wash dev` Quickstart

:::info[Prerequisites]
This tutorial assumes you already have `wash` installed. If you don't, refer to the [**installation instructions**](/docs/installation.mdx) first.
:::

Here's a quick guide to getting started with wasmCloud and `wash dev`.

First, run `wash new` to scaffold a new project:

```console
wash new component wdev
```

After selecting what kind of project you'd like to build, you should see output like the following:

```
➜ wash new component wdev
✔ Select a project template: · hello-world-rust: a hello-world component (in Rust) that responds over an HTTP connection
🔧 Cloning template from repo wasmCloud/wasmCloud subfolder examples/rust/components/http-hello-world...
🔧 Using template subfolder examples/rust/components/http-hello-world...
🔧 Generating template...
✨ Done! New project created /tmp/wdev

Project generated and is located at: /tmp/wdev
```

Next, change into the directory that was created:

```console
cd wdev
```

You should *immediately* be able to run `wash dev` and build the project:

```console
wash dev
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```

```

`wash dev` won't return, but if you're working on an example like a HTTP server, it will tell you where you can access the running application (in this case, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, AKA `localhost:8000`).

`wash dev` did the work of starting wasmCloud, a HTTP provider, your component, and hooking all of the pieces up so you could simply `curl localhost:8000`:

```
$ curl localhost:8000
Hello from Rust!
```

## Configuring `wash` (and `wash dev`)

Configuration for `wash` is stored in `wasmcloud.toml`. While template projects contain basic options, there are many more to consider. 

See [the `wasmcloud.toml` config reference][reference-toml-config] for more information.

[reference-toml-config]: /docs/reference/config
