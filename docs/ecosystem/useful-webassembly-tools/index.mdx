Beyond the wasmCloud toolchain, the WebAssembly community maintains many open source projects that are invaluable for Wasm users. This is a non-comprehensive list of tools we've found particularly useful.

## WIT Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting can make WIT definitions easier to read and bring a more legible WIT experience to your IDE. Here are a few options for syntax highlighting in popular editors:

### VS Code WIT Syntax Highlighting

The [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/vscode-wit/) maintained by the Bytecode Alliance can be installed either via the [extensions marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BytecodeAlliance.wit-idl) or manually.

#### VS Code Extension Manual installation

For a manual install, you will need [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/vscode-wit.git && cd vscode-wit
```

```shell
npm ci && npm run install-plugin
```

### Neovim WIT Syntax Highlighting

The [tree-sitter-wit](https://github.com/liamwh/tree-sitter-wit/) Tree-sitter parser maintained by [liamwh](https://github.com/liamwh) can be installed with [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter). Installation instructions can be found on either of the two linked repositories.

## WIT dependency management with `wit-deps`

It's important to ensure consistency between the WIT dependencies defined in your `deps.toml` manifest and the actual files in your project. [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps) is a simple dependency management CLI tool maintained by the Bytecode Alliance that ensures your dependencies are consistently and correctly populated.

You will need [Rust and `cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Install `wit-deps` by running:

```shell
cargo install wit-deps-cli
```

Run `wit-deps` from the root of a wasmCloud project directory (one level above `wit`) to populate the `deps` directory with the definitions specified in `deps.toml` and create a `deps.lock` file:

```shell
wit-deps
```

For more detail on `wit-deps`, see the [documentation in the project README](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps).

## WebAssembly artifact manipulation with `wasm-tools`

Sometimes you might want to observe or manipulate a component independently of wasmCloud&mdash;perhaps to view the component's WIT interface, compose Wasm components into one, or even for more niche jobs like converting a WebAssembly module to a component. The [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) CLI tool is a utility belt with a long list of options.

You will need [Rust and `cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Install `wasm-tools` by running:

```shell
cargo install wasm-tools
```

## A standalone WebAssembly runtime: Wasmtime

[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is the WebAssembly runtime used by the wasmCloud host. If you'd like to test a component against standalone Wasmtime or explore runtime features, you can also install Wasmtime locally and use it to run components.

To install on Linux or macOs run:

```shell
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

## Virtualize components with WASI Virt

[WASI Virt](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt) allows you to encapsulate a virtualized component within another component. This is particularly useful when you want to use potentially sensitive WASI APIs such as Sockets and Filesystem but don't want to give them access to core operating system interfaces.

WASI Virt requires the nightly release channel for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Install the `wasi-virt` command line tool with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt
```
Learn more about using WASI Virt with wasmCloud on the [Virtualize](/docs/developer/components/virtualize) developer page.

## Combine components with WebAssembly Compositions (WAC)

[WAC](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac) is a powerful CLI tool for declaratively composing components, enabling you to [link components at build](/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-build). WAC uses a superset of WIT called WAC to describe component relationships. You can learn how to use the WAC language in the [WAC language guide](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac/blob/main/LANGUAGE.md). 

WAC requires [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Once you've installed Cargo:

```shell
cargo install wac-cli
```
