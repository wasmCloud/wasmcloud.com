# Installation

First, we'll install `wash`, the WAsmcloud SHell, which we'll use to
install, run, and manage our wasmCloud components.
Select your preferred installation method below, then run the displayed commands in your favorite terminal.

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
  <TabItem value="ubuntudebian" label="Ubuntu/Debian" default>

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install wash
```

It is always a good idea to inspect scripts before piping them directly into `sudo bash`.

Below are the contents of `script.deb.sh` for your verification.

```bash

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

For the smoothest experience, we recommend that Windows users run wasmCloud with **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** and follow the **Ubuntu/Debian** instructions throughout the documentation.

Microsoft provides [documentation for getting started with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [using WSL with Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).

When using WSL, we recommend choosing the `Ubuntu` distro (`wsl --install -d Ubuntu`).

You may need to update `git` to the latest version using the Ubuntu Git Maintainers' Personal Package Archive (PPA):

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
```
```shell
sudo apt-get update
```
```shell
sudo apt-get install git
```

When your WSL environment is ready, you can use the standard Ubuntu/Debian installation method:

```shell
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```
```shell
sudo apt install wash
```

If you are unable to use WSL, you can use the native binary installation below, but **note that native Windows support is experimental**.

```powershell
choco install wash
```

If you're using the native Windows binary, you can install wasmCloud's supported language toolchains on Windows as follows:

### Go toolchain

On Windows, you can use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install the Go toolchain (as well as the [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) tool to compile components on Windows):

```shell
scoop install go
```

```shell
scoop install tinygo@0.33.0
```

```shell
scoop install binaryen
```

### Rust toolchain

On **Windows**, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `rustup`, and then use `rustup` to install the Windows toolchain:

```shell
choco install rustup.install
```

```shell
rustup toolchain install stable-msvc
```

Note: On Windows, you will also need Visual Studio's C++ tools.

Once you've installed Rust, use `rustup` to add the `wasm32-wasip2` target:

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

### TypeScript toolchain

On Windows, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `npm` (and Node.js):

```shell
choco install nodejs
```



  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

If your platform isn't listed, `wash` can be installed with `cargo` and a Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo install --locked wash
```

If you have [`cargo-binstall`][cargo-binstall] installed, you can install even faster:

```bash
cargo binstall wash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="Source">

The [wash project](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/wash-cli) is open-source and can be cloned from
GitHub and built locally with a Rust toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud.git
cd wasmCloud/crates/wash-cli
cargo build --release
cd ../..
./target/release/wash
```

:::info
You'll also want to add `wash` to your `PATH` to easily run it. Refer to instructions specific to
your operating system for how to do this.
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Compose">

:::warning
If you only use Docker Compose without installing `wash`, you'll only be able to interact with
wasmCloud via the washboard.
:::

Download the [sample Docker Compose file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-full.yml) and put it into your work directory. This compose file will run NATS, a local OCI registry, Grafana and Tempo for OTEL, and the `wasmcloud_host` container. In this format it's easy to run all the necessary services for a wasmCloud host with only a docker installation.

With the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory, start the processes with

```bash
docker compose up
```

The host will run until you type Ctrl-C or close the terminal window. To start the docker compose process in the background, add a `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If the wasmCloud host is running in Docker in the background, you can view its logs (live) with

```bash
docker logs -f wasmcloud
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that `wash` is properly installed with:

```bash
wash --help
```

If wash is installed correctly, you will see a printout of all available commands and short descriptions for each.
If you ever need more detail on a specific command or sub-command just run `wash <command> --help`.

Now that `wash` is installed, let's [get started](/docs/tour/hello-world).
