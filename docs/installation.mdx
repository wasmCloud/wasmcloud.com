# Installation

:::warning[Under Construction]
🚧 This page is under active renovation for wasmCloud 1.0. Some details may not be aligned with v1.0 during the alpha period. 🚧
:::

First, we'll install `wash`, the WAsmcloud SHell, which we'll use to
install, run, and manage our wasmCloud components.
Select your preferred installation method below, then run the displayed commands in your favorite terminal.

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install wash

The [wash project](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/wash-cli) is open-source and can be cloned from

cd crates/wash-cli

You'll also want to add `wash` to your `PATH` to easily run it. Refer to instructions specific to
your operating system for how to do this.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Compose">

:::warning
If you only use Docker Compose without installing `wash`, you'll only be able to interact with
wasmCloud via the washboard.
:::

Download the [sample Docker Compose file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-full.yml) and put it into your work directory. This compose file will run NATS, a local OCI registry, Grafana and Tempo for OTEL, and the `wasmcloud_host` container. In this format it's easy to run all the necessary services for a wasmCloud host with only a docker installation.

With the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory, start the processes with

```bash
docker compose up
```

The host will run until you type Ctrl-C or close the terminal window. To start the docker compose process in the background, add a `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If the wasmCloud host is running in Docker in the background, you can view its logs (live) with

```bash
docker logs -f wasmcloud
```

  </TabItem>

Verify that `wash` is properly installed with:

```bash
wash --help
```

If wash is installed correctly, you will see a printout of all available commands and short descriptions for each.
If you ever need more detail on a specific command or sub-command just run `wash <command> --help`.

Now that `wash` is installed, let's [get started](/docs/tour/hello-world).
