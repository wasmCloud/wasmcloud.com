# Installation

First, we'll install `wash`, the WAsmcloud SHell, which we'll use to 
install, run, and manage our wasmCloud components.
Select your preferred installation method below, then run the displayed commands in your favorite terminal.

  <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

If your platform isn't listed, `wash` can be installed with `cargo` and a Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo install wash-cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="Source">

The [wash repository](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash) is open-source and can be cloned from
GitHub and built locally with a Rust toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash.git
cd wash
cargo build --release
./target/release/wash
```

:::info
You'll also want to add `wash` to your `PATH` to easily run it. Refer to instructions specific to
your operating system for how to do this.

  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Compose">

:::caution
If you only use Docker Compose without installing `wash`, you'll only be able to interact with
wasmCloud via the washboard.
:::

Download the [sample Docker Compose
file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/examples/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) and put
it into your work directory. This compose file will run NATS, a local OCI registry, a Redis
container, Grafana and Tempo for OTEL, and the `wasmcloud_host` container. In this format it's easy
to run all the necessary services for a wasmCloud host with only a docker installation.

With the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory, start the processes with

```bash
docker compose up
```

The host will run until you type Ctrl-C or close the terminal window. To start the docker compose process in the background, add a `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If the wasmCloud host is running in docker in the background, you can view its logs (live) with

```bash
docker logs -f wasmcloud
```

  </TabItem>

That's it! Now that `wash` is installed, let's [get started](/docs/tour/hello_world).
