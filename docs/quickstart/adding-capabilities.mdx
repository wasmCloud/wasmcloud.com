# Adding Capabilities

TODO convert actor to component

Going from "Hello World" to a full-fledged application requires just identifying what capabilities your application needs, and then adding them to your actor. Capabilities in wasmCloud can invoke a function handler in your actor in response to some external trigger (like HTTP Server and Messaging) and actors can invoke capabilities as a part of handling a request (like key-value store and logging). "Hello World" already has the HTTP Server capability, so let's add more features to this application with functional code and more capabilities.

## Adding Functionality

Let's extend this application to do more than just say "Hello World". We can use the `HttpRequest` struct and check the request for a name provided in a query string, and then return a greeting with that name.

```rust
async fn handle_request(&self, ctx: &Context, req: &HttpRequest) -> RpcResult<HttpResponse> {
    let name = match req.query_string.split("=").collect::<Vec<&str>>()[..] {
        // query string is "name=<name>" e.g. localhost:8080?name=Bob
        ["name", name] => name.to_string(),
        // query string is anything else or empty e.g. localhost:8080
        _ => "World".to_string(),
    };

    Ok(HttpResponse::ok(format!("Hello, {}!", name,)))
}
```

Using a simple pattern match, we can check to see if we can split the query string on a name parameter, and if so, use that name in the response. If not, we'll just use "World" as the name. This won't support adding multiple query parameters but it's a perfectly good start for our goals.

## Deploying your Actor

Now that we're making modifications to the actor, you'll want to run your local copy instead of the wasmCloud example that's already deployed. To do this, we can edit the manifest to instead point at a local file. You can easily find this path by running `wash build -o json` and looking for **actor_path** in the output. Simply take that and prepend `file://` to the absolute path to avoid any reliance on the current working directory.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: hello
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.2 # Make sure to upgrade the version
    description: "wasmCloud Hello World Example"
spec:
  components:
    - name: hello
      type: actor
      properties:
        # Change the image to point at your local file
        image: file:///Users/wasmcloud/hello/build/docs_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Now you can simply deploy the new version of your application, and then you can try out your new feature! **wadm** will take care of updating your actor to your local copy.

:::info
Whenever you make a change to your actor that you want to deploy, be sure to run `wash build` to recompile and generate a new .wasm file.
:::

```bash
> wash app deploy wadm.yaml
> curl localhost:8080
Hello, World!
> curl 'localhost:8080?name=Bob'
Hello, Bob!
```

## Adding Persistent Storage

To further enhance our application, let's add persistent storage to keep a record of each person that this application greeted. We'll use the key-value store capability for this, and just like HTTP server, you won't need to pick a library or a specific vendor implementation yet. You'll just need to add the capability to your actor, and then you can pick a capability provider at runtime.

We'll start by adding the key-value interface in your project and then declare `wasmcloud:keyvalue` as a capability claim so that wasmCloud will allow your actor to use the capability.

```bash
# Add the key-value interface to your Cargo project
cargo add wasmcloud-interface-keyvalue
```

```toml
# wasmcloud.toml
[actor]
claims = ["wasmcloud:httpserver", "wasmcloud:keyvalue"]
```

Now we can make use of the key-value capability. Add a few imports at the top of your file:

```rust
use wasmcloud_interface_keyvalue::{KeyValue, KeyValueSender, SetAddRequest};
```

Then, add this line after you parse the name from the query string:

```rust
async fn handle_request(&self, ctx: &Context, req: &HttpRequest) -> RpcResult<HttpResponse> {
    let name = match req.query_string.split("=").collect::<Vec<&str>>()[..] {
        ["name", name] => {
            KeyValueSender::new()
                .set_add(
                    ctx,
                    &SetAddRequest {
                        set_name: "names".to_string(),
                        value: name.to_string(),
                    },
                )
                .await?;
            name.to_string()
        }
        _ => "World".to_string(),
    };
}
```

The modified code will now, whenever a name is provided, add it to the set of greeted names in our key-value store. We still need a way to retrieve the names, so let's add another arm to our match statement to check if the query string is just `names`, and return each name:

```rust
    async fn handle_request(&self, ctx: &Context, req: &HttpRequest) -> RpcResult<HttpResponse> {
        let name = match req.query_string.split("=").collect::<Vec<&str>>()[..] {
            ["name", name] => {
                KeyValueSender::new()
                    .set_add(
                        ctx,
                        &SetAddRequest {
                            set_name: "names".to_string(),
                            value: name.to_string(),
                        },
                    )
                    .await?;
                name.to_string()
            }
            ["names"] => KeyValueSender::new()
                .set_query(ctx, "names")
                .await?
                .join(", "),
            _ => "World".to_string(),
        };

        Ok(HttpResponse::ok(format!("Hello, {}!", name,)))
    }
```

### Deploying a Key-Value Store Provider

Our actor is prepared to use a key-value store, and now that we've built it we're ready to choose an implementation. A great option for local development and testing is the [Redis provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/kvredis), and will only require you to have `redis-server` or Docker installed.

<Tabs queryString="redis">
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local Redis Server" default>

[Install](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) and launch the local redis server in the background

```bash
redis-server &
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

Launch a Redis container in the background

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can modify our `wadm.yaml` to include the Redis provider and configure a link for our actor. Since we're nearing the end of this tutorial, we'll provide the full manifest here:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.3 # Remember to bump the version!
    description: "wasmCloud Hello World Example"
spec:
  components:
    - name: hello
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: file:///Users/wasmcloud/hello/build/docs_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080
        # The new key-value link configuration
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: keyvalue
            values:
              address: redis://127.0.0.1:6379

    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
    # The new capability provider
    - name: keyvalue
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/kvredis:0.21.1
        contract: wasmcloud:keyvalue
```

For the last step, we can deploy the `v0.0.3` version of our application. Then, again, we can test our new functionality.

```bash
> wash app deploy wadm.yaml
> curl localhost:8080?name=Bob
Hello, Bob!
> curl localhost:8080?name=Alice
Hello, Alice!
> curl localhost:8080?names
Hello, Bob, Alice!
```

## Moving on

TODO make this a callout to workflow

In this tutorial, you added a few more features and persistent storage to a simple microservice. You also got to see the process of developing with interfaces, where the code you write is purely functional, doesn't require you to pick a library or vendor upfront, and allows you to change your application separately from its non-functional requirements. You can continue to build on this application by adding more features, or you can explore additional capabilities and providers in the [wasmCloud Capability Providers repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers) to get an idea of what is possible with wasmCloud.

The next page gives a high level overview of why this application that you've built already eliminates complexity and pain that developers often face when building applications for the cloud.
