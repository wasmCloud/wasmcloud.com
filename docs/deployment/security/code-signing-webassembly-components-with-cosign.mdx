# Securely Signing WebAssembly Components with Cosign (OIDC)

As WebAssembly (Wasm) adoption accelerates, ensuring **artifact integrity and authenticity** becomes essential. Just like traditional packages, **WebAssembly components** should be signed, stored, and verified before deploying in production.

In this guide, we use [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to **sign WebAssembly component artifacts**, push them to an **OCI-compliant registry** (GHCR), and **verify** them prior to execution. We’ll use **OIDC-based signing** (no long-lived keys) so signatures are linked to an identity and stored as **invisible infrastructure** alongside your artifact.

---

## Why Sign WebAssembly Components?

- **Integrity**: Ensure the component wasn’t modified post-build.  
- **Authenticity**: Bind the artifact to a known publisher identity.  
- **Compliance**: Align with modern supply-chain expectations (SLSA, NIST).  
- **Trust in deployment**: Configure only verified artifacts run under wasmCloud or Kubernetes via admission controller.

---

## Step 1: Create a New WebAssembly Component

Generate a Rust-based WebAssembly component with `wash`:

```bash
▶ wash new
✔ What programming language do you want to use? · Rust
✔ Which template would you like to use? · http-hello-world
✔ You selected the template 'http-hello-world' (https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud). Do you want to proceed? · yes
2025-09-01T15:23:20.088858Z  INFO cloning git repository template="https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud"
2025-09-01T15:23:29.742343Z  INFO Successfully cloned template output_dir=http-hello-world
2025-09-01T15:23:29.751026Z  INFO extracting subfolder subfolder=examples/rust/components/http-hello-world
2025-09-01T15:23:30.015867Z  INFO successfully extracted subfolder subfolder="examples/rust/components/http-hello-world"
Successfully created project from template http-hello-world
```

---

## Step 2: Build the Component

Compile in release mode for WASI P2:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Confirm our WebAssembly Component has been built:

```bash
▶ ls -la target/wasm32-wasip2/release/http_hello_world.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 liam  staff  237872 Sep  1 11:47 target/wasm32-wasip2/release/http_hello_world.wasm
```

At only **~238 KB**, this artifact is tiny— great for **fast startup** with out **cold starts**, **low bandwidth distribution**, and **lightweight deployments**. Combined with Wasm’s **capability-driven security model** (least-privilege capabilities explicitly granted), WebAssembly components deliver both **efficiency** and **safety** by design.  CNCF wasmCloud is designed to run thousands of WebAssembly Components simultaneously.

If you want to test or enter a build/dev loop on this container you can use `wash dev` at this time.

---

## Step 3: Prepare Authentication for GitHub Container Registry

Before using any `cosign` commands to upload or sign against `ghcr.io`, authenticate Docker and confirm your GitHub PAT permissions.

> ⚠️ **Note on GHCR Authentication & PAT Scopes**  
> - **Verify PAT**: Confirm your Personal Access Token (PAT) used for `docker login ghcr.io` is valid and not expired.  
> - **Permissions**: Ensure the PAT has:  
>   - `read:packages` (pull)  
>   - `write:packages` (push)  
> - **Generate a new PAT** if unsure, with the scopes above.

Authenticate:

```bash
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password-stdin
```

---

> 📘 **Before You Sign or Verify**  
> There are **multiple ways** to sign and verify artifacts with Cosign (key-pair, keyless/OIDC, hardware-backed, GitHub Actions, etc.). This tutorial demonstrates **OIDC (keyless) signing** for WebAssembly artifacts.  CNCF wasmCloud is compatible with multiple strategies for artifact signing; in this blogpost we are just demonstrating on possible method.
> See the Sigstore docs for a broader overview:  
> https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/

---

## Step 4: Upload the WebAssembly Component to GHCR

Upload the built Wasm artifact (note the path):

```bash
cosign upload wasm -f target/wasm32-wasip2/release/http_hello_world.wasm ghcr.io/<your-org>/http-hello-world
```

---

## Step 5: Sign the WebAssembly Component with Cosign (OIDC, No Key)

With **OIDC mode**, you don’t specify a `--key`. Cosign will:

1. Launch a browser flow to authenticate you with an **OIDC provider** (e.g., Google, GitHub).  
2. Generate **ephemeral keys**.  
3. Obtain a **short-lived signing certificate** binding your identity to the signature.  
4. Store the signature **with the artifact in the registry** and record it in the **transparency log** (Rekor).

> ℹ️ **Cosign Philosophy**: Signatures should be **invisible infrastructure**—living beside your artifact in the registry without adding operational friction for consumers.

> ✅ **Best Practice**: **Always sign by digest** (`@sha256:...`) rather than a tag (e.g., `:latest`). Tags move; digests uniquely identify the content you intend to sign.

### Example Signing a WebAssembly Component

```bash
▶ cosign sign ghcr.io/liamrandall/http-hello-world@sha256:9e7a511fb3130ee4641baf1adc0400bed674d4afc3f1b81bb581c3c8f613f812

```

**What’s happening here?**  
- Cosign refreshes trusted metadata (TUF), generates a short-lived key pair, and retrieves a **signed certificate**.  
- You confirm the **immutability** and **public transparency** of the record (Rekor).  
- Browser-based OIDC auth binds your identity (e.g., `liam@cosmonic.com`) to the certificate.  
- Cosign **pushes the signature** to GHCR and **records** it in the transparency log.

## Step 5.1: Retrieve the Signer’s Public Certificate from the Transparency Log (Rekor)

Every OIDC (keyless) signature is recorded in the **Rekor transparency log**, an append-only, publicly auditable ledger. Each entry includes the **ephemeral public key certificate** used to sign the artifact. You can retrieve it for auditing, pinning, or offline validation.

Use the **log index** from the signing output above (`tlog entry created with index: 457070846`) to fetch the entry:

```bash
▶ rekor-cli get --log-index 457070846
LogID: c0d23d6ad406973f9559f3ba2d1ca01f84147d8ffc5b8445c224f98b9591801d

      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What is this?**  
- **Rekor entry**: A tamper-evident record storing a hash of the content and metadata about the signature.  
- **`publicKey.content`**: A **base64-encoded PEM** of the short-lived **X.509 code-signing certificate** issued during OIDC signing. It binds your OIDC identity to the signature.  
- **Use cases**: Extract the certificate for auditing, pinning identities, or performing offline verification flows.

**Extract the PEM-encoded certificate to a file:**

```bash
rekor-cli get --log-index 457070846 --format json   | jq -r '.Body.HashedRekordObj.signature.publicKey.content'   | base64 -d > signer-cert.pem

# Inspect the certificate
openssl x509 -in signer-cert.pem -noout -subject -issuer -dates
```

You can also retrieve by UUID instead of index:

```bash
rekor-cli get --uuid 108e9186e8c5677ae2e00d3b5962864ce70caf89477763e66e37b3570d54962f2ab0b136abfda517 --format json
```

> 🔎 **Note**: Manual Rekor retrieval isn’t required for `cosign verify` (the Rekor bundle is embedded), but it’s useful for **audits**, **forensics**, or **air‑gapped validations** where you want explicit control over verification inputs.

---

## Step 6: Verify the Signed WebAssembly Component (Identity-Scoped)

For OIDC-signed artifacts, you can verify and assert the **expected identity** and **OIDC issuer**:

### Example (provided)

```bash
▶ cosign verify ghcr.io/liamrandall/http-hello-world@sha256:9e7a511fb3130ee4641baf1adc0400bed674d4afc3f1b81bb581c3c8f613f812  --certificate-identity=liam@cosmonic.com --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://accounts.google.com
setting TUF refresh period to 24h0m0s

Verification for ghcr.io/liamrandall/http-hello-world@sha256:9e7a511fb3130ee4641baf1adc0400bed674d4afc3f1b81bb581c3c8f613f812 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"ghcr.io/liamrandall/http-hello-world"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:9e7a511fb3130ee4641baf1adc0400bed674d4afc3f1b81bb581c3c8f613f812"},"type":"cosign container image signature"},"optional":{"1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1":"https://accounts.google.com","Bundle":{"SignedEntryTimestamp":"MEUCIHNYPM+GmCIg15yJTSw5R5Jw6PQQATDJ5y5Us3qkPvArAiEA74QKnrIJAGJSDAdX1NhLOICs1W0WG1or8Ff4xKYGKyE=","Payload":{"body":"eyJhcGlWZXJzaW9uIjoi...
```

**What this means**  
- **Claims validated**: Cosign verified the signature payload structure and contents.  
- **Transparency log proof**: The signature exists in Rekor, and verification can occur offline using the embedded bundle.  
- **Certificate chain**: The short-lived **code-signing certificate** chains to a trusted CA, and the **Subject** (`liam@cosmonic.com`) with **Issuer** (`https://accounts.google.com`) matches your verification flags.  
- The `docker-manifest-digest` equals the digest you signed, proving the exact artifact was verified.

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build (WASI Preview 2)
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2

# Upload Wasm to GHCR
cosign upload wasm -f target/wasm32-wasip2/release/http_hello_world.wasm ghcr.io/<your-org>/http-hello-world

# Sign by digest (OIDC, no --key)
cosign sign ghcr.io/<your-org>/http-hello-world@sha256:<digest>

# Verify with identity constraints
cosign verify ghcr.io/<your-org>/http-hello-world@sha256:<digest>   --certificate-identity=<your-email>   --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://accounts.google.com
```

---

## Conclusion

By pairing **WebAssembly’s capability-driven security** with **Cosign’s OIDC-based signing**, you get **portable, verifiable, and tamper-evident** components that slot naturally into your OCI registries. With signatures as **invisible infrastructure**, wasmCloud deployments can enforce trust without operational complexity.
