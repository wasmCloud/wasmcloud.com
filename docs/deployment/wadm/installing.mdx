:::warning[Planned changes to scheduling]
The [**wasmCloud Q3 2025 Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) sets out plans for an overhaul to scheduling in the next major release of wasmCloud. The new scheduling API will not use NATS to communicate between components by default, but will still support distributed communication via NATS. For more information, see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) and [Issue #4640: “Intentional distributed networking.”](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/4640)
:::

`wadm` releases include a standalone binary and Docker image.

### Standalone Binary

Binaries are included in [each release of `wadm`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/releases/latest). The following platforms are supported:

- Linux (x86_64)
- Linux (aarch64)
- MacOS (x86_64)
- MacOS (aarch64)
- Windows

In you are interested in other ways to install `wadm`, please let us know by opening [an issue](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/issues)!

:::

After downloading the appropriate release, extract the `wadm` binary and move it somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `mv wadm /usr/local/bin/wadm`).

### Docker

A list of all available wadm images is on [GitHub packages](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/pkgs/container/wadm). In addition to tagged versions, we also have two additional tags:

- `latest` - The latest tagged release of wadm
- `canary` - The latest build of wadm from the `main` branch. **This is not recommended for production use.**
