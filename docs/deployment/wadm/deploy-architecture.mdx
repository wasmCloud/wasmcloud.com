:::warning[Planned changes to scheduling]
The [**wasmCloud Q3 2025 Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) sets out plans for an overhaul to scheduling in the next major release of wasmCloud. The new scheduling API will not use NATS to communicate between components by default, but will still support distributed communication via NATS. For more information, see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) and [Issue #4640: “Intentional distributed networking.”](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/4640)

:::info
These guides are for deploying `wadm` in **production**. For local development and testing, simply run `wash up`. For more information on `wadm`, see the [`wadm` docs](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).

### High availability and horizontal scaling by default

`wadm` is designed to be resilient, flexible, and easy to scale from a single instance to many. **No configuration is required to run additional instances.**

Each instance establishes and maintains in-memory state of a lattice based off [events](/docs/reference/cloud-event-list) emitted by hosts in the lattice, which means `wadm` instances can be restarted or scaled up and down without impacting the management of the lattice. 

Instances of `wadm` do not need to be run on the same system as a wasmCloud host; the only requirement is that instances have access to internal NATS subjects used by [lattices](/docs/concepts/lattice).

### Single lattice management

The simplest deployment pattern is to run a group of (one or more) `wadm` instances per lattice. This simplifies the requirements for the NATS credentials, since `wadm` only needs to subscribe to events and emit commands related to a single lattice. See [Configuring NATS Credentials](/docs/deployment/wadm/nats-credentials) for information on how to configure NATS credentials for `wadm`.

### Multi-lattice management

This pattern is slightly more complex than the single lattice management pattern. In this pattern, `wadm` manages multiple lattices associated with the same NATS cluster. This is useful for multi-tenant deployments of wasmCloud, managing a dev and staging environment together, etc.

Configuring `wadm` to manage multiple lattices is straightforward. The only additional requirement to configure `wadm` for multi-lattice management is ensuring the NATS credentials provided to `wadm` have permission on topics for _all_ lattices. For more information, see [Configuring NATS Credentials](/docs/deployment/wadm/nats-credentials)
