:::warning[Planned changes to scheduling]
The [**wasmCloud Q3 2025 Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) sets out plans for an overhaul to scheduling in the next major release of wasmCloud. The new scheduling API will not use NATS to communicate between components by default, but will still support distributed communication via NATS. For more information, see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7) and [Issue #4640: “Intentional distributed networking.”](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/4640)
:::

:::info
These guides are for deploying `wadm` in **production**. For local development and testing, simply run `wash up`. For more information on `wadm`, see the [`wadm` docs](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).

### Preconfiguring Storage

:::warning
The following is important to avoid data loss in production!
:::

`wadm` uses two NATS [Key Value buckets](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream/kv) for storage: application manifests, and lattice state.

#### Application manifests

The manifests bucket contains the "source of truth" for `wadm` applications. **If the manifest storage is lost, all knowledge of applications is gone**. For production deployments, we highly recommend preconfiguring this bucket with multiple replicas and taking backups regularly.

For example, to configure the manifests bucket with 3 replicas:

```bash
nats kv add wadm_manifests --history=1 --replicas=3 --storage=file
```

:::info
The default bucket name is `wadm_manifests`. If you use another name, you will need to set the `--manifest-bucket-name` flag
:::

#### Lattice state

If the state bucket is lost, `wadm` will self-heal and recover state over the next couple of minutes, as hosts report their state via events.


### Configuration Options

`wadm` is configured via command line flags or environment variables. The following configuration options are supported:

| Option                       | Environment Variable        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default Value                      |

| `--api-prefix`               | `WADM_API_PREFIX`           | The API topic prefix to use. This is an advanced setting that should only be used if you know what you are doing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `wadm`                             |
| `--stream-prefix`            | `WADM_STREAM_PREFIX`        | This prefix to used for the internal streams. When running in a multitenant environment, clients share the same JS domain (since messages need to come from lattices). Setting a stream prefix makes it possible to have a separate stream for different wadms running in a multitenant environment.
