## Overview

This deployment guide demonstrates how to deploy wasmCloud to a Kubernetes cluster using Akamai's Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) service, and then run wasmCloud applications built from WebAssembly components. 

To follow this guide, you will need an account for [Akamai Connected Cloud](https://login.linode.com/signup) and an [API access token](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#personal-access-tokens)

## Install tools

This guide uses **`kubectl`**, **Helm** and the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI. (For a Terraform deployment, see the [community contributions](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud-contrib) repository.)

### Install `kubectl`

Install the `kubectl` CLI for Kubernetes cluster management. 

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install kubernetes-cli
```
On Linux systems, you can use `curl` to download the latest release:

```shell
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```
Use `chmod` to make the `kubectl` binary executable:

```shell
chmod +x ./kubectl
```
Add the binary to your PATH:

```shell
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

### Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) serves as a package manager for Kubernetes. Follow the instructions on the [Helm install page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) or use the project's install script:

```shell
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### Install wash

Once wasmCloud is deployed to your LKE cluster, you can use the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI to manage wasmCloud applications. If you do not have `wash` installed locally, follow the instructions on the [install page](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

## Set up your cluster and `kubectl`

If you do not already have an LKE cluster on Akamai Connected Cloud, follow Akamai's instructions:

* [Create an LKE cluster](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/get-started/#create-an-lke-cluster) 
* [Download your kubeconfig](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/get-started/#access-and-download-your-kubeconfig)

Once your kubeconfig is downloaded, assign the filepath to the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/kubeconfig.yaml
```

## Deploying wasmCloud

You can run wasmCloud on Kubernetes with the [wasmCloud Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator). An operator is an extension that uses custom Kubernetes resources to manage an application&mdash;you can [learn more about the Kubernetes operator pattern in the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

Before deploying the operator, it is necessary to deploy two prerequisites to the cluster:

- **[NATS](/docs/ecosystem/nats/)** (with Jetstream enabled)
- **[wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/)** 

The following steps will help you deploy the prerequisites to your Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the operator.

### Deploy NATS

NATS is the open source connective technology that wasmCloud uses to create a unified topology across any number of environments. Add the NATS Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add nats https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/
```

Install the upstream NATS Helm chart to start a cluster with the `values.yaml` file from the wasmCloud operator repository:

```shell
helm upgrade --install -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/nats-values.yaml nats nats/nats
```

Validate the installation with:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=nats
```

#### Deploy wadm

wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm) enables declarative application deployment and management for wasmCloud. You can deploy wadm to your Kubernetes cluster with a Helm chart:

```shell
helm install wadm -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wadm-values.yaml oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wadm
```

Validate the installation with:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wadm
```

#### Deploy the wasmCloud operator

To deploy the operator:

```shell
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/deploy/base
```

Validate that the pods are ready:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy -l app=wasmcloud-operator -n wasmcloud-operator
```
Validate that the apiservice is available:

```shell
kubectl wait --for condition=available apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io v1beta1.core.oam.dev
```

### Create wasmCloud host

Apply the `wasmcloud-host` manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wasmcloud-host.yaml
```

Check wasmCloud host status:

```shell
kubectl describe wasmcloudhostconfig wasmcloud-host
```

### Run a WebAssembly component on Kubernetes

When you `kubectl apply` a [wasmCloud application manifest](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), the cluster automatically provisions the component workload with wasmCloud. 

This example uses the [`hello-world-application.yaml` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml) included in the operator's quickstart. (The [source code for the application](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-hello-world) is available in the wasmCloud repository.)

Below is an excerpt of the manifest:

```yaml {7-7}
...
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
...
```
The component is packaged as an OCI artifact and specified in the `image` field. This isn't a container, but a component conforming to OCI standards, meaning that it can be used with existing registries for container images. 

Run `kubectl apply`: 

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

View the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
```
```text
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

When you run a wasmCloud application that uses the `httpserver` provider with a daemonscaler, as this one does, the operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service for the application. 

View services:

```shell
kubectl get services
```
```text
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                        AGE
hello-world      ClusterIP   10.96.199.43    <none>        8080/TCP                                       11s
kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                                        6m29s
nats             ClusterIP   10.96.104.180   <none>        4222/TCP,7422/TCP,4223/TCP                     5m36s
nats-headless    ClusterIP   None            <none>        4222/TCP,7422/TCP,4223/TCP,6222/TCP,8222/TCP   5m36s
wasmcloud-host   ClusterIP   10.96.67.225    <none>        4222/TCP                                       84s

```

### Test the application

On a cluster without ingress (such as this one), you can still test the component from within the wasmCloud host container where the application is running. 

Assign the wasmCloud host pod name to an environment variable:

```shell
WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}" -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host)
```
Port-forward the wasmCloud host's port 8080:

```shell
kubectl port-forward pods/$WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD 8080
```
`curl` the application:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### Debugging

You can use `kubectl` to get logs from the wasmCloud host running on your LKE cluster:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host -c wasmcloud-host
```
#### Common mistakes

* If you're having trouble deploying an application, make sure your wadm application manifest references an OCI image and not a local file.
* If a service is not automatically generated for an application using the httpserver provider, check to ensure that the provider uses `daemonscaler` in the application manifest. (You can see an example of this in the [`hello-world-application` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml).)

### Manage applications with wash

To connect `wash` to the cluster, port-forward into the NATS service running in your Kubernetes cluster. (Note: `4222` is the port for the NATS service, `4223` is the port for NATS websockets.)

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223
```
Now you can connect to wasmCloud on Kubernetes with your local `wash` toolchain:

```shell
wash app list
```

View the `hello-world` application running on the Kubernetes cluster, manageable via our local `wash` CLI:

```text
Name          Latest Version   Deployed Version   Deploy Status  Description                                                                                                  
hello-world   v0.0.1           v0.0.1                  Deployed  HTTP hello world demo in Rust, using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)
```

### Clean up

Delete the `hello-world` application:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

Delete the wasmCloud host and associated resources:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wasmcloud-host.yaml
```

Delete the operator:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/deploy/base
```

All resources installed via Helm can be removed with [`helm uninstall`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/).
