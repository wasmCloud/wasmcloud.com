wasmCloud is **compatible with, but not dependent on**, Kubernetes. We think the future of WebAssembly is bright, _and_ we also know there are plenty of systems already running in Kubernetes. For this reason, we provide the wasmCloud operator to help users run wasmCloud hosts on a Kubernetes cluster&mdash;and thereby run WebAssembly components on Kubernetes.

For high-level discussion of our approach to Kubernetes and compatibility with common cloud native tooling, see [wasmCloud on Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/).

On **this** page, you can find documentation for users wishing to deploy wasmCloud with Kubernetes, including details on prerequisites such as NATS, different strategies for deploying the platform, and how to deploy the wasmCloud operator.

## The wasmCloud platform on Kubernetes

As deployed on Kubernetes, the wasmCloud platform consists of three core parts:

* [wasmCloud host(s)](/docs/concepts/hosts.mdx) - Runtime environment for WebAssembly components
* [NATS with Jetstream](/docs/ecosystem/nats/index.mdx) - Connective technology underlying the wasmCloud [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice.mdx)
* [wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (`wadm`)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/index.md) - Scheduler for application lifecycle management

## Deployment with Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs) is commonly understood as a package manager for Kubernetes, enabling platform teams to install and manage software on Kubernetes clusters. Deployments are defined in declarative [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) that describe the relationship between various Kubernetes resources.

The wasmCloud project has chosen to embrace Helm as the tool for managing wasmCloud on Kubernetes. We also provide an optional **wasmCloud Operator** to facilitate smoother automation of the platform. [Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) automate the management of complex, stateful applications, continuously monitoring the state of **custom resources** and making real-time adjustments to align the actual state with the desired state specified by the user. 


When deploying wasmCloud to Kubernetes with Helm, NATS and `wadm` are provisioned by the [`wasmcloud-platform`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform) chart. The final part of the deployment&mdash;a wasmCloud host&mdash;is added through one of two **mutually exclusive** sub-charts: 

* [`wasmcloud-host`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/charts/wasmcloud-host)
* [`wasmcloud-operator`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/tree/main/charts/wasmcloud-operator)

By default, the `wasmcloud-platform` chart deploys hosts using the operator, but it may be easily configured to use the more "manual" `wasmcloud-host` subchart instead. This choice distinguishes the two primary patterns for deploying and operating the wasmCloud platform on Kubernetes:

* Platform and operator
* Platform-only

We generally recommend that teams use the **platform and operator pattern**, but both of these patterns have their own use-cases and strengths that teams should consider when planning a deployment.

### Platform and operator

The platform and operator pattern is the preferred strategy for deploying wasmCloud on Kubernetes, since it automates much of the platform's management and functionality. Kubernetes operators use [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) to extend the Kubernetes API and manage applications in a Kubernetes-native way.

The wasmCloud operator can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator) and enables the following:


1. Declarative wasmCloud management via Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), with wasmCloud hosts managed by the `WasmCloudHostConfig` CRD, encoding best practices for deploying wasmCloud hosts
2. Interoperability with the [wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/) for deploying wasmcloud applications defined in the [OAM spec](https://oam.dev/) format, so that a wasmCloud application can be deployed with a single `kubectl apply`
3. Kubernetes services integration, automatically creating services for wasmCloud applications deployed with a HTTP Server capability (in the future this will become configurable).

#### Deploying the platform and operator

In order to follow the instructions on this page, you will need a Kubernetes (>=1.24.0) cluster and appropriate access credentials as well as a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) (>=3.8.0) installation. It will also be useful to have [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](/docs/installation) installed locally.

:::info[Running Kubernetes locally]
Some good options for local Kubernetes include [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [k3s](https://k3s.io/), or [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/).
:::

In order to deploy wasmCloud in the platform and operator pattern, first install the `wasmcloud-platform` Helm chart. By default, the chart installs NATS, `wadm`, and the wasmCloud operator subchart.

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --dependency-update
```

Wait for all components to install and `wadm-nats` communications to establish:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nats
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wadm
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wasmcloud-operator
```

Next create a wasmCloud host:

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --dependency-update \
    --set "hostConfig.enabled=true"
```

If the deployment is successful, you should receive the note:

```shell
‚ú® Congratulations! Your wasmCloud platform has been deployed successfully.
   - üõÄ To use the wash cli with your new wasmCloud platform, run:
    kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223

   - üó∫Ô∏è  To launch the wasmCloud dashboard on http://localhost:3030, in a different terminal window, run:
     wash ui
```

If you'd like, you can check wasmCloud host status:

```shell
kubectl describe wasmcloudhostconfig wasmcloud-host
```

#### Run a WebAssembly component on Kubernetes

When you `kubectl apply` a [wasmCloud application manifest](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), the cluster automatically provisions the component workload with wasmCloud. 

This example uses the [`hello-world-application.yaml` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml) included in the operator's quickstart. (The [source code for the application](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-hello-world) is available in the wasmCloud repository.)

Below is an excerpt of the manifest:

```yaml {7-7}
...
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
...
```
The component is packaged as an OCI artifact and specified in the `image` field. This isn't a container, but a component conforming to OCI standards, meaning that it can be used with existing registries for container images. 

Run `kubectl apply`: 

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

Check the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
```

```shell
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

When you run a wasmCloud application that uses the `httpserver` provider with a daemonscaler, as this one does, the operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service for the application. 

:::warning[HTTP Server Address]
When you're using the HTTP Server provider in an application that will run on Kubernetes with the wasmCloud operator, make sure the application manifest configures the provider to use the address `0.0.0.0`, for example:

```yaml {15-15}
- name: httpserver
  type: capability
  properties:
    image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.21.0
  traits:
    - type: link
      properties:
        target: http-component
        namespace: wasi
        package: http
        interfaces: [incoming-handler]
        source_config:
          - name: default-http
            properties:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Because of the way the application runs within a wasmCloud host pod, using `127.0.0.1` results in networking errors when running on Kubernetes. 
:::

View services:

```shell
kubectl get services
```
```text
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                        AGE

```

#### Test the application

On a cluster without ingress (such as this one), you can still test the component from within the wasmCloud host container where the application is running. 

Assign the wasmCloud host pod name to an environment variable:

```shell
WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}" -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host)
```
Port-forward the wasmCloud host's port 8000:

```shell
kubectl port-forward pods/$WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD 8000
```
`curl` the application:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000
```

You should get the response:

```plaintext
Hello from Rust!
```

#### Debugging

You can use `kubectl` to get logs from the wasmCloud host running on your cluster:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host -c wasmcloud-host
```

You can use a debug pod to test connections to an HTTP application's service from within the cluster:

```shell
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- sh
```

Once the command prompt appears, you can try running `curl` against the service name and port of your application. For the `hello-world` application in the guide above, this would look like:

```shell
curl hello-world:8000
```

##### Common mistakes

* If you're having trouble deploying an application, make sure your wadm application manifest references an OCI image and not a local file.
* If a service is not automatically generated for an application using the httpserver provider, check to ensure that the provider uses `daemonscaler` in the application manifest. (You can see an example of this in the [`hello-world-application` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml).)
* If you're having trouble connecting to an application that uses the HTTP Server provider, make sure it is configured to use the address `0.0.0.0`. 

#### Manage applications with `wash`

Connect your local `wash` with the wasmCloud deployment. `4222` is the port for the NATS service and `4223` is the port for NATS websockets.

```shell
kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223
```

Now you can use your local `wash` toolchain with your wasmCloud deployment:

```shell
wash get inventory
```
The output should look like this:

```plaintext

  hostcore.arch                 aarch64

  hello_world-httpserver        http-server-provider   
```

You can watch a [video of operator deployment on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/239Q_hAKqPw?si=y0nHeFHfCPOdItNU&start=235&end=780):

<YouTube url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=239Q_hAKqPw&start=235&amp;end=780" />

#### Optional configuration

##### Image pull secrets (Optional)

You can also specify an image pull secret to use use with the wasmCloud hosts so that they can pull components from a private registry. This secret needs to be in the same namespace as the WasmCloudHostConfig CRD and must be a
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` type secret. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials) for more information on how to provision that secret.

Once it is created, you can reference an image pull secret in the `WasmCloudHostConfig` CRD by
setting the `registryCredentialsSecret` field to the name of the secret.

##### Argo CD Health Check (Optional)

Argo CD provides a way to define a [custom health check](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/#custom-health-checks) that it then runs against a given resource to determine whether or not the resource is in healthy state.

For this purpose, we specifically expose a `status.phase` field, which exposes the underlying status information from wadm.

With the following ConfigMap, a custom health check can be added to an existing
Argo CD installation for tracking the health of wadm applications.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  resource.customizations: |
    core.oam.dev/Application:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Reconciling application state"
        if obj.status ~= nil and obj.status.phase ~= nil then
          if obj.status.phase == "Deployed" then
            hs.status = "Healthy"
            hs.message = "Application is ready"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Reconciling" then
            hs.status = "Progressing"
            hs.message = "Application has been deployed"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Failed" then
            hs.status = "Degraded"
            hs.message = "Application failed to deploy"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Undeployed" then
            hs.status = "Suspended"
            hs.message = "Application is undeployed"
          end
        end
        return hs
```

### Platform-only

The platform-only pattern is intended for organizational environments in which the use of Kubernetes operators is restricted. 

In order to deploy wasmCloud in the platform-only pattern, first install the `wasmcloud-platform` Helm chart with the `operator.enabled` value set to `false`:

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --set "operator.enabled=false" \
    --dependency-update
```

Wait for all components to install and `wadm-nats` communications to establish:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nats
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wadm
```

Next install the `wasmcloud-host` subchart:

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --set "host.enabled=true" \
    --dependency-update
```

If the deployment is successful, you should receive the note:

```shell
‚ú® Congratulations! Your wasmCloud platform has been deployed successfully.
   - üõÄ To use the wash cli with your new wasmCloud platform, run:
    kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223

   - üó∫Ô∏è  To launch the wasmCloud dashboard on http://localhost:3030, in a different terminal window, run:
     wash ui
```

If you follow the instructions to run the `kubectl port-forward`, you can test the local `wash` connection:

```shell
wash get inventory
```

This command should return the Kubernetes node and pod name for the wasmCloud host (your node and pod name will differ):

```text                                                                                                                              hostcore.arch             aarch64                                               
  hostcore.os               linux                                                 
  hostcore.osfamily         unix                                                  
  kubernetes                true                                                  
  kubernetes_node_name      minikube                                              
  kubernetes_pod_name       wasmcloud-7cb4d4c7cb-jr                               
                            gd8                                                   
                                                                                  
  No components found                                                             
                                                                                  
  No providers found          
```

From this point, you can deploy a wasmCloud application using the `wash` toolchain. (Note that you cannot use kubectl to deploy a wasmCloud application manifest as you can when using the wasmCloud operator.)

```shell
wash app deploy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

If you run `wash get inventory` again, you will see that the wasmCloud application is running on Kubernetes.
