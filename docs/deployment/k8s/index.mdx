wasmCloud is **compatible with, but not dependent on**, Kubernetes. We think the future of WebAssembly is bright, _and_ we also know there are plenty of systems already running in Kubernetes.

### Official wasmCloud Helm Chart

To make it easy to try out wasmCloud and/or integrate it with existing deployments, wasmCloud publishes an [official Helm chart][helm-chart].

To get started quickly and see usage examples, read the ["Running the Chart" guide][helm-chart-quickstart] on the [chart README][helm-chart-docs].

For a complete listing of configuration for the Helm chart, jump straight to the [`values.yaml`][helm-chart-values.yaml].

### Kubernetes Service Applier

Cosmonic has open sourced a basic connector that enables bridging services running in Kubernetes with services running in wasmCloud.

The interface, provider, and component can be found at [on Github under `cosmonic/kubernetes-applier`][k8s-applier].

Check out the project's [documentation][k8s-applier-readme] for a complete example architecture and instructions on how to run it.
