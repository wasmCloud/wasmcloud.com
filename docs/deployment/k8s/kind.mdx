## Overview

[**kind**](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a Kubernetes distribution designed to run local clusters for local development or CI, using nodes that run as containers. 

This deployment guide will demonstrate how to deploy wasmCloud to a kind cluster and run wasmCloud applications built from WebAssembly components. 

## Install tools

In addition to kind and the **container tooling** a kind cluster requires to run, this guide uses **Helm** and the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI. (For an alternative, script-driven kind quickstart using Kustomize, see the [community contributions](https://github.com/wasmCloud/contrib) repository.)

### Install container tooling

kind requires container tooling and supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/), and [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl). Install the container toolchain of your choice before installing kind.

### Install kind

If you do not already have kind, you can install it with the [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/install). 

```shell
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.23.0 
```
You may need to add your Go binary folder to your PATH as well: 

```shell
export PATH=${PATH}:`go env GOPATH`/bin
```

Start a local Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
EOF
```

### Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) serves as a package manager for Kubernetes. Follow the instructions on the [Helm install page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) or use the project's install script:

```shell
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### Install wash

Once wasmCloud is deployed to your kind cluster, you can use the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI to manage wasmCloud applications. If you do not have `wash` installed locally, follow the instructions on the [install page](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

## Deploying wasmCloud

Once a `kind` cluster is running locally, you can run wasmCloud on Kubernetes with the [wasmCloud Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator). An operator is an extension that uses custom Kubernetes resources to manage an application&mdash;you can [learn more about the Kubernetes operator pattern in the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

In order to deploy wasmCloud on kind, first install the `wasmcloud-platform` Helm chart. By default, the chart installs NATS, `wadm`, and the wasmCloud operator subchart.

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --dependency-update
```

Wait for all components to install and `wadm-nats` communications to establish:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nats
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wadm
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wasmcloud-operator
```

Next create a wasmCloud host:

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
    --dependency-update \
    --set "hostConfig.enabled=true"
```

If the deployment is successful, you should receive the note:

```shell
✨ Congratulations! Your wasmCloud platform has been deployed successfully.
   - 🛀 To use the wash cli with your new wasmCloud platform, run:
    kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223

   - 🗺️  To launch the wasmCloud dashboard on http://localhost:3030, in a different terminal window, run:
     wash ui
```

If you'd like, you can check wasmCloud host status:

```shell
kubectl describe wasmcloudhostconfig wasmcloud-host
```

### Run a WebAssembly component on Kubernetes

When you `kubectl apply` a [wasmCloud application manifest](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), the cluster automatically provisions the component workload with wasmCloud. 

This example uses the [`hello-world-application.yaml` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml) included in the operator's quickstart. (The [source code for the application](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-hello-world) is available in the wasmCloud repository.)

Below is an excerpt of the manifest:

```yaml {7-7}
...
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
...
```
The component is packaged as an OCI artifact and specified in the `image` field. This isn't a container, but a component conforming to OCI standards, meaning that it can be used with existing registries for container images. 

Run `kubectl apply`: 

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

View the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
```
```text
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

When you run a wasmCloud application that uses the `httpserver` provider with a daemonscaler, as this one does, the operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service for the application. 

View services:

```shell
kubectl get services
```
```text
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                        AGE
hello-world      ClusterIP   10.96.199.43    <none>        8000/TCP                                       11s
kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                                        6m29s
nats             ClusterIP   10.96.104.180   <none>        4222/TCP,7422/TCP,4223/TCP                     5m36s
nats-headless    ClusterIP   None            <none>        4222/TCP,7422/TCP,4223/TCP,6222/TCP,8222/TCP   5m36s
wasmcloud-host   ClusterIP   10.96.67.225    <none>        4222/TCP                                       84s

```

### Test the application

On a cluster without ingress (such as this one), you can still test the component from within the wasmCloud host container where the application is running. 

Assign the wasmCloud host pod name to an environment variable:

```shell
WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}" -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host)
```
Port-forward the wasmCloud host's port 8000:

```shell
kubectl port-forward pods/$WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD 8000
```
`curl` the application:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000
```

### Debugging

You can use `kubectl` to get logs from the wasmCloud host running on your kind cluster:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host -c wasmcloud-host
```

You can use a debug pod to test connections to an HTTP application's service from within the cluster:

```shell
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- sh
```

Once the command prompt appears, you can try running `curl` against the service name and port of your application. For the `hello-world` application in the guide above, this would look like:

```shell
curl hello-world:8000
```

##### Common mistakes

* If you're having trouble deploying an application, make sure your wadm application manifest references an OCI image and not a local file.
* If a service is not automatically generated for an application using the httpserver provider, check to ensure that the provider uses `daemonscaler` in the application manifest. (You can see an example of this in the [`hello-world-application` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml).)
* If you're having trouble connecting to an application that uses the HTTP Server provider, make sure it is configured to use the address `0.0.0.0`. 

### Manage applications with wash

To connect `wash` to the cluster, port-forward into the NATS service running in your Kubernetes cluster. (Note: `4222` is the port for the NATS service, `4223` is the port for NATS websockets.)

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223
```
Now you can connect to wasmCloud on Kubernetes with your local `wash` toolchain:

```shell
wash app list
```

View the `hello-world` application running on the Kubernetes cluster, manageable via our local `wash` CLI:

```text
Name          Latest Version   Deployed Version   Deploy Status  Description                                                                                                  
hello-world   v0.0.1           v0.0.1                  Deployed  HTTP hello world demo in Rust, using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)
```

### Clean up

To delete the kind cluster when you are finished:

```shell
kind delete cluster
