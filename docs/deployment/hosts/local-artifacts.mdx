When running wasmCloud locally using `wash up`, it's simple to deploy applications using local file references. This enables rapid iteration and testing of applications during development, by not having to push and pull artifacts to a registry. In a production environment, however, deploying artifacts from a filesystem is not always wise, as local artifacts are not immutable and may be tampered with.

Fortunately, **the wasmCloud host denies requests to start components and providers from local artifacts** by default.

:::info
When using `wash up` for local development, wash overrides this behavior and enables loading from file references, via the [`--allow-file-load` option](/docs/reference/host-config) on the host. If for some reason it is necessary to start from a file reference in production, this option can be enabled.
