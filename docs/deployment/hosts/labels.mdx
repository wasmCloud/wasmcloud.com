wasmCloud hosts are associated with a set of label key-value pairs. Labels are used to distinguish hosts in [auctions](/docs/deployment/hosts/auctions) and schedule workloads with [`wadm`](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).

### Built-in Labels

All hosts include the following auto-generated labels:

- `hostcore.arch` (e.g. `aarch64`)
- `hostcore.os` (e.g. `linux`)
- `hostcore.osfamily` (e.g. `unix`)

### Providing Labels at Start Time

Users can supply an arbitrary number of additional labels using [host config](/docs/cli/wasmcloud) values. For example, `wash up -l foo=bar`.

### Dynamically Adjusting Labels

Since labels are used for auctions and scheduling workloads, it's useful to be able to dynamically adjust a host's label at runtime. For example, consider a label like `cordon`, which might be used to indicate that a host should not be eligible for any new workloads. Hosts respond to requests to put/delete labels via the [control interface](/docs/hosts/lattice-protocols/control-interface) over `wasmbus.ctl.v1.{lattice}.label.[put|del].{host-id}`.

You can use the `wash label` command to add labels easily:

```shell
wash label <host-id> key=value cloud=aws region=us-east-1
```

Additionally, you can add the `--delete` flag to delete a set of labels
```shell
wash label <host-id> key=value cloud=aws region=us-east-1 --delete
```
