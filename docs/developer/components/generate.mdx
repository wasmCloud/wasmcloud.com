Let's create a component that accepts an HTTP request and responds with "Hello from Rust!" 

To create your new component project, change to the directory where you want the project to be created, and enter the command below. 

* The first term on the command (`hello`) is the project name. If you choose a different project name, the name of the subdirectory and some symbols in the generated code will be different from the example code in this guide.
* Every new wasmCloud project is created from a template. If you do not specify a template, `wash` will give you options to select. In this case, we're using the `hello-world-rust` template. You can find [this template hosted in the wasmCloud monorepo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-hello-world). 

```bash
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-rust
```

Navigate to the new `hello` directory and take a look at the generated project. The file `src/lib.rs` includes a `wit-bindgen` generate macro, an imports section, a struct `HttpServer`, and an `impl` block that implements the `Guest` trait for the component struct. Let's walk through these sections in detail.

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!();
```

This shows us that we're using a core wasmCloud package called `wit-bindgen` to generate the types and bindings for our component. This is automatically done from the `wit/world.wit` file, any changes to imports or exports will update automatically on the next build.

Note the two lines near the top of the source code file:

```rust
use exports::wasi::http::incoming_handler::Guest;
use wasi::http::types::*;
```

These two imports are bringing in the `Guest` trait to implement our function to be called whenever an incoming HTTP request is received, and the types that we'll use to interact with the HTTP request and response. These are the only two imports that we need to interact with the HTTP server capability.

```rust
struct HttpServer;

impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) {
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();
        response_body
            .write()
            .unwrap()
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n")
            .unwrap();
        OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
        ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
    }
}
```

Within the `handle` method, the component receives the HTTP request, creates an `OutgoingResponse` and writes that response out back to the requesting http client (such as a `curl` command or a web browser).

Finally, we use the `wit-bindgen` generated macro `export!` to export the `HttpServer` struct as the incoming handler for the HTTP server capability. If you don't implement the `Guest` trait for your struct, the `export!` macro will give you an error at compile time noting which functions you need to implement.

```rust
export!(HttpServer);
```

Let's create a component that accepts an HTTP request and responds with "Hello from Go!" 

To create your new component project, change to the directory where you want the project to be created, and enter the command below. 

* The first term on the command (`hello`) is the project name. If you choose a different project name, the name of the subdirectory and some symbols in the generated code will be different from the example code in this guide.
* Every new wasmCloud project is created from a template. If you do not specify a template, `wash` will give you options to select. In this case, we're using the `hello-world-tinygo` template. You can find [this template hosted in the wasmCloud monorepo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/golang/components/http-hello-world). 

```bash
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-tinygo
```

Navigate to the new `hello` directory and take a look at the generated project. The file `main.go` includes imports, `init` and `handleRequest` functions, and an empty `main` function. 

Let's walk through these pieces in depth.

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go generate --world hello --out gen ./wit
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/net/wasihttp"
)

func init() {
	// Register the handleRequest function as the handler for all incoming requests.
	wasihttp.HandleFunc(handleRequest)
}

func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Go!\n")
}

// Since we don't run this program like a CLI, the `main` function is empty. Instead,
// we call the `handleRequest` function when an HTTP request is received.
func main() {}
```

* **The Go directive at the very top** ensures that when we build our project with `tinygo build`, the `wit-bindgen-go` tool will be run to generate the bindings for our component from the `hello` WIT world found in the `./wit` directory. Bindings will be generated in the `gen` directory.
* **In the import section**, we import Go's standard `fmt` and `net/http` libraries. We also import the `wasihttp` package, which provides an implementation of `http.Handler` backed by `wasi:http`&mdash;enabling us to write idiomatic Go using a language-agnostic WASI interface.
* **In the `init` section**, we set the `handleRequest` function to handle incoming HTTP requests.
* **In the `handleRequest` function**, we respond to an HTTP request by printing `Hello from Go!`
* **The main function is empty**, since the component doesn't run like a CLI, but instead runs the `handleRequest` function when triggered by an HTTP request.

Let's create a component that accepts an HTTP request and responds with "Hello from TypeScript!  

To create your new component project, change to the directory where you want the project to be created, and enter the command below. 

* The first term on the command (`hello`) is the project name. If you choose a different project name, the name of the subdirectory and some symbols in the generated code will be different from the example code in this guide.
* Every new wasmCloud project is created from a template. If you do not specify a template, `wash` will give you options to select. In this case, we're using the `hello-world-typescript` template. You can find [this template hosted in the wasmCloud monorepo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/typescript/components/http-hello-world). 

```bash
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-typescript
```

Navigate to the new `hello` directory and take a look at the generated project. The file `http-hello-world.ts` will include imports and a `handle` function exported under `incomingHandler`. Let's walk through these pieces in depth.

```typescript
import { IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam, OutgoingResponse, Fields } from 'wasi:http/types@0.2.0';
```

The import section of this file imports our generated types (from `jco`) for the WASI HTTP interface.

```typescript
// Implementation of wasi-http incoming-handler
//
// NOTE: To understand the types involved, take a look at wit/deps/http/types.wit
function handle(req: IncomingRequest, resp: ResponseOutparam) {
  // Start building an outgoing response
  const outgoingResponse = new OutgoingResponse(new Fields());

  // Access the outgoing response body
  let outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body();
  {
    // Create a stream for the response body
    let outputStream = outgoingBody.write();
    // Write hello world to the response stream
    outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(
      new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode('Hello from Typescript!\n')),
    );
    // @ts-ignore: This is required in order to dispose the stream before we return
    outputStream[Symbol.dispose]();
  }

  // Set the status code for the response
  outgoingResponse.setStatusCode(200);
  // Finish the response body
  OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, undefined);
  // Set the created response
  ResponseOutparam.set(resp, { tag: 'ok', val: outgoingResponse });
}
```

The business logic of our component is contained within the `handle` function. Within the `handle` function, the component receives the HTTP request, creates an `OutgoingResponse` and writes that response back out to the requesting HTTP client (such as a `curl` command or a web browser).

```typescript
export const incomingHandler = {
  handle,
};
```

Lastly, this export statement includes the `handle` function under the `incomingHandler` interface, which matches the `wasi:http/incoming-handler` interface declared in the application's [wit file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/typescript/components/http-hello-world/wit/index.wit).

Let's create a component that accepts an HTTP request and responds with "Hello from Python!" 

To create your new component project, change to the directory where you want the project to be created, and enter the command below. 

* The first term on the command (`hello`) is the project name. If you choose a different project name, the name of the subdirectory and some symbols in the generated code will be different from the example code in this guide.

You can find [this template hosted in the wasmCloud monorepo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/python/components/http-hello-world). 

```bash
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-python
```

Navigate to the new `hello` directory and take a look at the generated project. The file `app.py` will include imports and a `handle` function on a `IncomingHandler` class. Let's walk through these pieces in depth.

```python
from hello import exports
from hello.types import Ok
from hello.imports.types import (
    IncomingRequest, ResponseOutparam,
    OutgoingResponse, Fields, OutgoingBody
)
```

In the import section of this file, we import our generated types (from `componentize-py`) for the WASI HTTP interface.

```python
class IncomingHandler(exports.IncomingHandler):
    def handle(self, _: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam):
        # Construct the HTTP response to send back
        outgoingResponse = OutgoingResponse(Fields.from_list([]))
        # Set the status code to OK
        outgoingResponse.set_status_code(200)
        outgoingBody = outgoingResponse.body()
        # Write our Hello World message to the response body
        outgoingBody.write().blocking_write_and_flush(bytes("Hello from Python!\n", "utf-8"))
        OutgoingBody.finish(outgoingBody, None)
        # Set and send the HTTP response
        ResponseOutparam.set(response_out, Ok(outgoingResponse))
```

The business logic of our component is contained within the `handle` method. Within the `handle` method, the component receives the HTTP request, creates an `OutgoingResponse` and writes that response back out to the requesting HTTP client (such as a `curl` command or a web browser).

This method is defined on the `IncomingHandler` class, which matches the `wasi:http/incoming-handler` interface declared in the application's [wit file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/python/components/http-hello-world/wit/world.wit).

If you use an IDE that comes with code completion and hover-tooltips, you'll be able to see documentation and get strongly-typed guidance as you develop code to interact with the WASI interfaces.

:::info
The above component example works without any modification in wasmCloud, but is specifically built using standard WebAssembly tooling. You do not need to use a wasmCloud-specific SDK to build components, and the above example will work directly with any WebAssembly runtime that supports the Wasm component model.

### Something's missing

Before we get into modifying the scaffolding to create the rest of this component, take a look at what's _not_ included in this code. This code returns an abstraction of an HTTP response. It is _not_ tightly coupled to any particular HTTP server. Furthermore, you don't see the port number or server configuration options anywhere in the code. Finally, you can scale and compose this component any way you see fit without ever having to recompile or redeploy it.

This method of [interface driven development](/docs/0.82/concepts/interface-driven-development) is a core piece of the wasmCloud project philosophy. You should be able to write business logic in a language of your choice without having to worry about the non-functional requirements of your application, letting you configure loosely coupled abstractions at runtime. Moving on past our project scaffolding, the next step is to build and run our component.
