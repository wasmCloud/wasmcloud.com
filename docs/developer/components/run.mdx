In the [first getting started guide](/docs/tour/hello-world) of wasmCloud you deployed a component using wadm via the `wash app deploy` command.
Now, we're going to start the component "the long way" so that you can get a feel for all of the moving parts of the process. Our tooling documentation should help you get components started more easily, once you've been through this guide.

We assume you've already [installed](/docs/installation) wash, the wasmCloud host, and necessary prerequisites.

### Build the component

Building the component is as easy as running `wash build` in the project's root directory. The previous [Build](/docs/developer/components/build) page has more details on the build process.

### Start the component

:::info
If you don't have a host running, you can start one with `wash up`.
:::

The simplest way to get a component running is by starting it from a locally built file. wasmCloud has support for starting built and signed components from absolute paths in addition to starting from OCI registries.

The `wash build` output will include the path to the locally built component. You can then use `wash` to start the component.

```bash
# wash start component <path-to-component> <component-id>
wash start component file:///Users/wasmcloud/hello/build/http_hello_world_s.wasm hello
```

If you're running the wasmCloud dashboard with `wash ui`, you can take a look at your running component by visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Alternatively, you can use `wash` to query the inventory of your running hosts:

```bash
wash get inventory
```

```console
➜ wash get inventory

  Host Inventory (NBPDHEE4FT75YJ7DLY2Y6W6WA2Z26ISRHSO5X3XBFBPAV53EI3GCPBHV)

  hostcore.os                        macos
  hostcore.arch                      aarch64
  hostcore.osfamily                  unix

  Component ID                       Name                      Image Reference
  hello                              http-hello-world          file:///Users/wasmcloud/hello/build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```

### Start the web server

We know our new component needs a web server, so let's start the HTTP server capability provider.

```bash
wash start provider ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.22.0 http-server
```

### Add a link

```bash
> wash inspect --wit ./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```

```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  # ..imports

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0; # [!code ++]
}
```

With both the provider and the component running, the next step is to [link](/docs/concepts/linking-components/) the two. Our component implements the function `wasi:http/incoming-handler.handle`, and the wasmCloud HTTP server provider is configured to call that function whenever it receives an HTTP request on the specified port.

First, create a [named configuration](/docs/developer/components/configure) for the HTTP server capability provider:

```bash
wash config put hello-listen-address address=0.0.0.0:8085
```

Then, link the provider to the component and pass the configuration to the provider (the source of the link):

```bash
# wash link put <source> <target> <namespace> <package> --source-config <config> --interface <interface>
wash link put http-server hello wasi http --source-config hello-listen-address --interface incoming-handler
```

At this point your HTTP server capability provider has been notified that a link definition was created, and it started the corresponding web server listening on port `8087`. You can now hit that endpoint and exercise the code you just wrote:

```bash
curl localhost:8085
```

and you should get the response:

```console
Hello from Rust!
```

This page took you through the process of imperatively starting a component and a capability provider, and then linking them together. You can use these commands as you develop to work with running resources, or just use [wash app](/docs/cli/wash#wash-app) to deploy the same resources declaratively.

Let's make a slight modification to the code, so you can see what it's like to go through a development iteration to compile and update the running code. Don't worry - this will be pretty quick.
