wasmCloud can help build simple components *and* complex components. While `wash` and wasmCloud utility libraries (in Rust, crates like [`wasmcloud-component`][wasmcloud-component])
provide what you'll need to build components along with useful helpers, adding complexity can sometimes make it difficult to use ecosystem tooling.

This page documents some advanced use-cases for more complex components, along with implementation and configuration patterns.

# Reusing code from helper libraries with custom interfaces (e.g. `wasmcloud-component`)

When building a component that contains custom interfaces *in addition* to using a standardized interfaces like `wasi:http`, your component's WIT interface might look something like this:

```wit
package example:component;

interface transform {
   transform-bytes: func(data: list<u8>) -> result<list<u8>, string>;
}

world transformer {
   export transform;
   export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.2;
}
```

While it's not important how the `transform-bytes` function works, what's important is that from the same component we expose *both*
a `wasi:http/incoming-handler` and the original `transform` interface.

It's *likely* that this component makes it possible to run transformation logic both when called directly from a Wasm host
(via `example:component/transform.transform-bytes`), *and* when called via a HTTP request (i.e. `wasi:http/incoming-handler.handle`,
triggered via a web request to the wasmCloud HTTP provider).

[`wasmcloud-component`][wasmcloud-component] makes it incredibly easy to deal with web requests, providing utilities familiar to
Rust developers based on standard ecosystem types rather than the robust (but often verbose) fully generated `wasi:http` bindings.

Using `wasmcloud-component` means you can write code like this:

```rust
// ...

/// Implementation of our WASI interfaces will hang from this struct
struct Component;

// ... implementation of the transform trait for the component ...

// Implementation of our standardized `wasi:http` interface
//
// By using the Server trait, we can fill out the wasi:http/incoming-handler impl via
// a much more native interface rather than only generated bindings
impl wasmcloud_component::http::Server for Component {
    fn handle(
        request: http::IncomingRequest,
    ) -> http::Result<http::Response<impl http::OutgoingBody>> {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Problem: Helper crates with pre-defined WASI exports

While `wasmcloud_component` is helpful, in the example component it causes an issue -- the component must implement *two* exports:

- `wasi:http/incoming-handler` (`wasmcloud-component` helps with this)
- `transform`

**The `wasmcloud_component` crate can't know anything about `transform`, but this causes a problem because `wasmcloud_component` performs**
**the primary interface export for *all* of the bindings of the component**

This causes an issue when building our component that often looks like the following:

```
linking with `wasm-component-ld` failed: exit status: 1
error: failed to encode component

          Caused by:
              0: failed to decode world from module
              1: module was not valid
              2: failed to find export of interface `example:component/transform` function `transform-bytes`
```

## Solution: Merging pre-defined exports with local custom interfaces, using `wit-bindgen` manually

To make this work properly, we'll need to write code that uses [`wit-bindgen`][wit-bindgen], rather than *just* `wasmcloud-component`:

```rust
mod bindings {
    use super::Component;

    wit_bindgen::generate!({
        with: {
            // Here we re-use the existing bindings that were generated in `wasmcloud_component`.
            //
            // Due to this re-use, the `wasmcloud::http::export!` will work properly and satisfy
            // the types that are expected by *our* component, because we instruct wit-bindgen
            // that the appropriate types for the import *are* the ones from `wasmcloud_component`.
            //
            // If we were to try to `generate` this binding ourselves, we'd have similarly *named*
            // interfaces, but the code in `wasmcloud_component` could not reference the modules &
            // types generated in this crate -- they'd be named similarly, but be different (so you'd
            // get an error that [your version of] the interface wasn't satisfied, despite
            // the wasmcloud_component export! below).
            //
            // For info on options to generate!, see:
            //   https://docs.rs/wit-bindgen/0.38.0/wit_bindgen/macro.generate.html
            //
            "wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.2": wasmcloud_component::wasi::exports::http::incoming_handler,
        },
        generate_all
    });

    export!(Component);
    wasmcloud_component::http::export!(Component);
}

/// Implementation of our WASI interfaces will hang from this struct
struct Component;

use bindings::exports::example::component::transform;

// Implementation of our custom `transform` interface
impl transform::Guest for Component {
    fn transform_bytes(_data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
        todo!()
    }
}

// Implementation of our standardized `wasi:http` interface
//
// By using the Server trait, we can fill out the wasi:http/incoming-handler impl via
// a much more native interface rather than only generated bindings
impl http::Server for Component {
    fn handle(
        request: http::IncomingRequest,
    ) -> http::Result<http::Response<impl http::OutgoingBody>> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

By dropping down to "manual" `wit-bindgen`, we can use the `with` option to specify that we want to *reuse* bindings made available by another crate in our current crate,
keeping the use of the better ergonomics of `http::Server` while still being able to export our `transform::Guest` implementation via the `Component` struct.
