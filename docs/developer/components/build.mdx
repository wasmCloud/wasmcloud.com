The [wash CLI](/docs/installation) includes a `build` command that is used to build all [components](/docs/concepts/components). The [`wash build`](/docs/cli/wash#wash-build) CLI reference page has more information on each of the command's flags. The rest of this page will focus on practical examples of using the `wash build` command.

You can see the list of supported [languages](/docs/reference/config#wasmcloudtoml-spec) in the `wasmcloud.toml` specification. At the time of writing this guide, this includes Rust and TinyGo. If a language is supported in the `wasmcloud.toml` specification, then you can build it simply with:

```bash
wash build
```

In a Rust project, the `wash build` command encapsulates a few commands. You can always use the standard Rust toolchain and Bytecode Alliance tools to build your components. However, the `wash build` command will automatically use the necessary tools and build your component for you. A `wash build` command performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# Build the Wasm module
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
# Create a Wasm component from the Wasm module by using the wasmtime adapter
wasm-tools component new ./target/wasm32-wasi/release/module.wasm -o ./build/component.wasm --adapt ./wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash claims sign ./build/component.wasm --destination ./build/component_s.wasm
```

In a TinyGo project, the `wash build` command encapsulates a few commands. You can always use the standard Go and TinyGo toolchain and Bytecode Alliance tools to build your components. However, the `wash build` command will automatically use the necessary tools and build your component for you. A `wash build` command performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# Generate the types and bindings for the Wasm module
go generate
# Build the Wasm module
tinygo build -o ./build/module.wasm -target wasm32-wasi -scheduler none -no-debug .
# Embed the component wit metadata into the module
wasm-tools component embed wit ./build/module.wasm > ./build/embed.wasm
# Create a Wasm component from the embedded Wasm module by using the wasmtime adapter
wasm-tools component new ./build/embed.wasm -o ./build/component.wasm --adapt ./wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash claims sign ./build/component.wasm --destination ./build/component_s.wasm
# Remove temporarily created files
rm ./build/embed.wasm ./build/module.wasm
```

    <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

In a TypeScript project, the wash build command must be overridden in the [wasmcloud.toml](/docs/reference/config) component section to use external tools. TypeScript builds require an [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) installation and, after running `npm install`, use [ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/) to compile transpiled JavaScript code into a WebAssembly Component.

```toml
[component]
build_command = "npm run build"
```

In our quickstart example, a `wash build` command performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# You must run `npm install` first
npm install
# Transpile TypeScript code to JavaScript
tsc
# Componentize JavaScript code
jco componentize -w wit -o dist/index.wasm dist/index.js
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash build --sign-only --config-path wasmcloud.toml
```

    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

In a Python project, the wash build command must be overridden in the [wasmcloud.toml](/docs/reference/config) component section to use external tools. Python builds require a [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installation and a [componentize-py](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py/) to compile Python code into a WebAssembly Component.

```toml
[component]
build_command = "componentize-py -d ./wit -w hello componentize app -o build/http_hello_world.wasm"
```

In our quickstart example, a `wash build` command performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# Componentize Python code into a WebAssembly Component
componentize-py -d ./wit -w hello componentize app -o build/http_hello_world.wasm
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash build --sign-only --config-path wasmcloud.toml
```

    <TabItem value="unlisted" label="My Language Isn't Listed">

`wash build` has an escape hatch in the `wasmcloud.toml` specification which will let you specify your own build command for languages that we don't have official support for. For example, following the [ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/blob/main/EXAMPLE.md) example to build a JavaScript Component, you can set up your `wasmcloud.toml` file like so:

```toml
name = "componentize-js"
language = "rust"
type = "component"

[component]
claims = ["wasmcloud:httpserver"]
build_command = "node componentize.mjs"
build_artifact = "hello.component.wasm"
destination = "hello_s.component.wasm"
```

Overriding the `build_command` allows you to use an external script or command to build the component, then specifying where the `build_artifact` is (wherever the component should be after the build command completes) lets `wash` still sign the component using your generated keys and information in the `wasmcloud.toml` file. Note that this command does not have full support for environment variables or multiple commands and should be in the form of "command arg1 arg2 arg...". It's recommended to use an external script to handle more complex build commands.

## Interface dependencies and `wash build`

When you run `wash build`, `wash` reads the specified world in your WIT files and downloads the appropriate dependencies automatically into the `wit/deps` directory. As such, in most cases you should add `wit/deps` to your `.gitignore` file and commit the generated `wasmcloud.lock` file.

Without any additional configuration, `wash` can download dependencies from the following namespaces (i.e. the `wasi` in `wasi:http@0.2.1`):

- `wasi`: Interfaces proposed for the common [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) standard](https://wasi.dev/)
- `wasmcloud`: Interfaces maintained as part of the wasmCloud project (see the [Capability Catalog](/docs/capabilities/) to find first-party interfaces)
- `wrpc`: [Interfaces](/docs/reference/wasi/wrpc-interfaces) maintained as part of the WIT-over-RPC (wRPC) project
- `ba`: Interfaces maintained by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/)

In most cases, dependency fetching and management should be fairly straightforward! As your usage of Wasm grows, however, you are likely to use dependencies that are not in the above namespaces (such as internal registries or other remappings). Also, if you plan to publish any custom interfaces, you will need to configure your registry with credentials. For instructions on registry authentication, see the [Publish](./publish.mdx) page. 

WIT interfaces are packaged and distributed as OCI artifacts. You can learn more about how the wasmCloud ecosystem uses OCI artifacts on the [Packaging](/docs/concepts/packaging.mdx) page.

### Migrating from `wit-deps`

Older versions of `wash` required a separate step using a `wit-deps` tool to download dependencies. This is no longer necessary with the newest versions of `wash`. To preserve backwards compatibility, if a `deps.toml` file is found in the `wit` directory of the project, `wash` will not fetch dependencies for you. To migrate to the new dependency management system, simply remove the `deps.toml` file and run `wash build` again. `wash build` will automatically remove all the old dependencies and download the new ones into your `wit/deps` directory.

:::warning
If you are using some of the provided wrpc interfaces like `wrpc:blobstore`, you will need to continue using `wit-deps`. This is due to an issue where some of the wrpc interfaces use syntax that is not yet available in the main WIT parser (but will be when WASI 0.3 is released) which causes the dependency resolution to fail.
