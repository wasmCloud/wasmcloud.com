# Building components with Go

The Go ecosystem provides developers with powerful options for building WebAssembly components. Go and the TinyGo fork provide a strong foundation for development:

* **TinyGo**: The fast-moving implementation of Go for embedded environments includes native compilation to components with WASI 0.2 support as of TinyGo 0.33. Since the project moves quickly, we always recommend using the latest version of TinyGo.
* **Go** has supported compilation to WebAssembly for years; we expect native WASI 0.2 support like that in TinyGo to land in the near future.

[`wasmCloud/Go`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main) is a repository containing Go ecosystem libraries and examples for wasmCloud. This repo serves as a centralized home for resources including the Component SDK package, component templates, component examples, and more.

## Go-native tooling

There are a number of useful tools available as Go packages that streamline and simplify the Go development experience:

### `go.bytecodealliance.org`

**`go.bytecodealliance.org`** ([GitHub](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/go-modules) | [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/go.bytecodealliance.org)) is a Go package hosted by the Bytecode Alliance that collects utilities such as `wit-bindgen-go`, which generates Go bindings for WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) interfaces. 

### `go.wasmcloud.dev/component`

**The Go Component SDK** ([GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main/component) | [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/go.wasmcloud.dev/component)) is an optional, open source framework that simplifies the development of WebAssembly components targeting the wasmCloud host runtime. The SDK aims to provide a more idiomatic Go development experience for developers using WASI interfaces such as `wasi:http` or `wasi:logging`.

### `go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge`

**`wadge`** ([GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadge) | [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge)) is a "bridging" framework that enables your native code to interact with WebAssembly component interfaces for purposes such as testing. `wadge` acts as a bridge between your Go toolchain and a WebAssembly runtime that makes interfaces “just work” when it's time to test your code. 

## Get started

In this walkthrough, we will create an HTTP server from scratch using the [Go Component SDK](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main/component), write a test for the application, and use `wadge` to run the test. This walkthrough requires:

* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.23.0+
* [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) 0.33.0+
* [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) CLI 0.36.1+ for building and deploying components
* [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation) for Go binding generation

### Step 1: Set up with `wash`

The wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) CLI helps developers build component-based applications that can be deployed with wasmCloud, and consolidates many open source component development tools. 

Create a new project called `http-test` and navigate into the project directory:

```shell
wash new component http-test --template-name hello-world-tinygo
```
```shell
cd http-test
```

Replace the contents of `world.wit` with the WIT definition below:

```wit
package example:http-server;

world hello {
  include wasmcloud:component-go/imports@0.1.0;
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Finally, we'll delete the contents of `main.go` and write our HTTP server, which will return a simple "hello world."

Using the Component SDK, this looks like a fairly standard server using the HTTP standard library, with only a handful of exceptions where we use methods of `wasihttp` or `wasilog`.

```go
//go:generate go run go run go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go generate --world hello --out gen ./wit

package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/net/wasihttp"
)

func init() {
	wasihttp.HandleFunc(handler)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	logger := wasilog.ContextLogger("handler")

	logger.Info("request received", "host", r.Host, "path", r.URL.Path, "agent", r.Header.Get("User-Agent"))

	_, err := w.Write([]byte("hello world!"))
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("failed to write body", "error", err)
	}
}

func main() {}
```

Add a `tools.go` file in your project so that the `wit-bindgen-go` tooling is able to generate the necessary bindings:
```shell
touch tools.go
```
```go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
)
```

Download missing packages:

```shell
go mod tidy
```
Replace the contents of `wasmcloud.toml` with the configuration below:

```toml
name = "http-hello-world"
language = "tinygo"
type = "component"
version = "0.1.0"

[component]
wasm_target = "wasm32-wasi-preview2"
wit_world = "hello"
```

When we run `wash build`, we will generate bindings and compile a component:

```shell
wash build
```

The `wash inspect` subcommand enables us to examine the new component's imports and exports:

```shell
wash inspect --wit build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```
```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:http/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:logging/logging;
  import wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.0;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.0;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Now we can deploy on wasmCloud and try the component manually.

* Start a developer loop with `wash dev`

In another tab, we can `curl` the application and you should see the "hello world" response:

```console
$ curl localhost:8000
hello world!
```

### Step 2: Testing with a WASI interface

[`wadge`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadge) is a "bridging" framework that will enable us to test our code using `go test` and standard test syntax.

Use `go get` to add `wadge` to the project:

```shell
go get go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge
```

Add a `tools.go` file to include the `wadge` bindgen:

```shell
touch tools.go
```

```go {diff} meta=tools.go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
	_ "go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/cmd/wadge-bindgen-go" // [!code ++]
)
```

Now we will write a test for the application in a new file called `hello_test.go`:

```shell
touch hello_test.go
```
```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"log"
	"log/slog"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	incominghandler "go.wasmcloud.dev/component/gen/wasi/http/incoming-handler"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/wadgehttp"
)

func init() {
	log.SetFlags(0)
	slog.SetDefault(slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelDebug, ReplaceAttr: func(groups []string, a slog.Attr) slog.Attr {
			if a.Key == slog.TimeKey {
				return slog.Attr{}
			}
			return a
		},
	})))
}

func TestIncomingHandler(t *testing.T) {
	wadge.RunTest(t, func() {
		req, err := http.NewRequest("", "/", nil)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to create new HTTP request: %s", err)
		}
		resp, err := wadgehttp.HandleIncomingRequest(incominghandler.Exports.Handle, req)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to handle incoming HTTP request: %s", err)
		}
		assert.Equal(t, 200, resp.StatusCode)
		assert.Equal(t, http.Header{}, resp.Header)
		buf, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to read HTTP response body: %s", err)
		}
		assert.Equal(t, []byte("hello world!"), buf)
	})
}
```
```shell
go mod download && go mod tidy
```
Generate `wadge` bindings for your test:

```shell
go run go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/cmd/wadge-bindgen-go
```

This generates `bindings.wadge.go`.

Now run `go test`:

```shell
go test
```
```text
level=DEBUG msg="reading response body buffer"
level=DEBUG msg="read body stream chunk" buf="hello world!"
level=DEBUG msg="reading response body buffer"
level=DEBUG msg="response body closed"
PASS
ok  	github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud/examples/golang/components/http-hello-world	0.299s
```

To clean up, stop `wash dev` with CTRL+C.

### Reference: Set up without `wash`

`wash` simplifies set up for a Go project, but it is not required to build a Go-based component. For users who wish to use or understand the underlying tooling, the steps below replicate the initial set up above without `wash`.

You'll also need to install the `wkg` cli to fetch your component's interface dependencies. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools#installation).

Once that is installed, run the following command to edit your wasm package tools configuration `wkg` to know the location of `wasmcloud` namespaced interface dependencies:

```shell
wkg config edit
```

Replace all content in that file with the following:

```toml
[namespace_registries]
wasmcloud = "wasmcloud.com"
wasi = "wasi.dev"
```

Create a new Go project:

```shell
mkdir http-test && cd http-test
```
```shell
go mod init example/http/test
```
Now we'll add the Component SDK and `wasilog` packages to our project:

```shell
go get go.wasmcloud.dev/component go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog 
```
Create a `wit/` directory and a file in that directory called `world.wit`:

```shell
mkdir wit && touch ./wit/world.wit
```
```wit
package example:http-server;

world hello {
  include wasmcloud:component/imports@0.2.0-draft;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Add the `go.bytecodealliance.org` package to a `tools.go` file in your project:

```shell
touch tools.go
```

```go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
)
```

Then update your Go module:
```shell
go mod tidy
```

Then fetch your dependencies:

```shell
wkg wit fetch
```

Finally, we'll write our HTTP server in a new `hello.go` file. Using the Component SDK, this looks like a standard server using the HTTP standard library.

```shell
touch hello.go
```
```go
//go:generate go run go run go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go generate --world hello --out gen ./wit

package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/net/wasihttp"
)

func init() {
	wasihttp.HandleFunc(handler)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	logger := wasilog.ContextLogger("handler")

	logger.Info("request received", "host", r.Host, "path", r.URL.Path, "agent", r.Header.Get("User-Agent"))

	_, err := w.Write([]byte("hello world!"))
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("failed to write body", "error", err)
	}
}

func main() {}
```
Now we'll generate Go bindings for the application's WIT interfaces.

```shell
mkdir gen
```
```shell
go generate
```
At this point, you can compile your Wasm component using `tinygo build`:

```shell
tinygo build --target=wasip2 --wit-package ./wit --wit-world hello
```
