# Go HTTP Server

[This example](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main/examples/component/http-server) is a
WebAssembly component that implements a simple HTTP server with multiple endpoints for handling various requests.

The application...

- Implements a [`wasi:http`][wasi-http]-compliant HTTP handler
- Uses the [`httpserver` provider][httpserver-provider] to serve requests
- Can be declaratively provisioned in a [wasmCloud][wasmCloud] environment

[wasi-http]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http
[httpserver-provider]: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/provider-http-server
[wasmCloud]: https://wasmcloud.com/docs/intro
[tinygo]: https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/
[wash]:  https://wasmcloud.com/docs/ecosystem/wash/
[wasm-tools]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation

## 📦 Dependencies

> [!WARNING]
> Due to incompatibilities introduced in `wasm-tools` v1.226.0, a version of
> `wasm-tools` <= 1.225.0 is **required** for running this example.
>
> You can install `wasm-tools` [v1.225.0 from upstream releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/releases/tag/v1.225.0), or use
> `cargo` ([Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)) -- (i.e. `cargo install --locked wasm-tools@1.225.0`)

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed in addition to the Go (1.23+) toolchain:

- [`tinygo`](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) for compiling Go (always use the latest version)
- [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation) for Go bindings
- [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) for building and running the components and wasmCloud environment

## 👟 Run the example

Clone the [wasmCloud/go repository](https://github.com/wasmcloud/go): 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/go.git
```

Change directory to `examples/component/http-server`:

```shell
cd examples/component/http-server
```

In addition to the standard elements of a Go project, the example directory includes the following files and directories:

- `build/`: Target directory for compiled `.wasm` binaries
- `gen/`: Target directory for Go bindings of [interfaces](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/interfaces)
- `wit/`: Directory for WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) packages that define interfaces
- `bindings.wadge_test.go`: Automatically generated test bindings
- `wadm.yaml`: Declarative application manifest
- `wasmcloud.lock`: Automatically generated lockfile for WIT packages
- `wasmcloud.toml`: Configuration file for a wasmCloud application

### Start a local development loop

Run `wash dev` to start a local development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

The `wash dev` command will:

- Start a local wasmCloud environment
- Build this component
- Deploy your application and all requirements to run the application locally, including...
  - Your locally built component
  - The [HTTP server provider][httpserver-provider], which will receive requests from the outside world
    (on port 8000 by default)
  - Necessary links between providers and your component so your component can handle web traffic
- Watch your code for changes and re-deploy when necessary.

Once the application is deployed, open another terminal tab. To ensure that the application has reached `Deployed` status, you can use `wash app list`:

```shell
wash app list
```

### Send a request

You can send a request to the following endpoints:

**GET /**

Returns a list of available endpoints and their descriptions.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000/
```
```text
  /error - return a 500 error
  /form - echo the fields of a POST request
  /headers - echo your user agent back as a server side header
  /post - echo the body of a POST request
```

**GET /error**

Returns a 500 Internal Server Error.

```shell
curl -v http://localhost:8000/error
```
```text
* Host localhost:8000 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:8000...
* connect to ::1 port 8000 from ::1 port 51390 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000
> GET /error HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
> 
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
< content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< x-content-type-options: nosniff
< vary: origin, access-control-request-method, access-control-request-headers
< access-control-allow-origin: *

< connection: close
< transfer-encoding: chunked
< date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 23:52:34 GMT
<

* Closing connection
```

**GET /headers**

Returns your User-Agent in the response headers.

```shell
curl -v http://localhost:8000/headers
```
```text
* Host localhost:8000 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:8000...
* connect to ::1 port 8000 from ::1 port 51499 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000
> GET /headers HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
> 
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

< connection: close
< transfer-encoding: chunked
< date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 23:53:49 GMT
< 
* Closing connection
Check headers!
```

**POST /form**

Echoes back form data from a POST request.

```shell
curl -X POST -d "field1=value1&field2=value2" http://localhost:8000/form
```
```text
field2: value2
field1: value1
```

**POST /post**

Echoes back the entire body of a POST request.

```shell
curl -X POST -d "Hello World" http://localhost:8000/post
```
```text
Hello World
```

### Clean up

You can cancel the `wash dev` process with `Ctrl-C`.

## ⚠️ Issues/FAQ

### `curl` produces a "failed to invoke" error

If `curl`ing produces...

```text
failed to invoke `wrpc:http/incoming-handler.handle`: failed to invoke `wrpc:http/incoming-handler@0.1.0.handle`: failed to shutdown synchronous parameter channel: not connected%
```

...the HTTP server may not have finished starting up. You can check that the application has reached `Deployed` status with `wash app list`. 

If the issue persists, you may have a lingering HTTP server provider running on your system. You can use `pgrep` to check:

```shell
pgrep -la ghcr_io
```
```text
4007604 /tmp/wasmcloudcache/NBCBQOZPJXTJEZDV2VNY32KGEMTLFVP2XJRZJ5FWEJJOXESJXXR2RO46/ghcr_io_wasmcloud_http_server_0_23_1
```
