## Overview

A **runtime link** is a declared connection between a component and another entity. Runtime links are typically defined in [Wadm deployment manifests](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/) and resolved on instantiation, regardless of where the linked entities are running.

Link definitions have both a **source** and a **target**, corresponding to the [component imports and exports](/docs/concepts/linking-components/), and specify the relevant WASI interfaces.

- In a link declaration, the **source** is the **importer**. You can think of it as the source of the requirement that needs to be fulfilled.
- The **target** is the **exporter**. Specifically, it is the function exposed in an export that the source will call.

Link definitions are **unidirectional**: the source (importer) can call the target (exporter), but not the other way around.From a [component's](/docs/concepts/components) point of view, code _only_ refers to an interface, e.g. `wasi-keyvalue`. Components do not know which specific entity is on the other side of a link.

## When to link at runtime

Linking at runtime makes sense when...

- You want components to be able to scale and failover independently
- You want to be able to update components independently
- Data sources for each component are distributed, and you want each component to run as close to its data source as possible to reduce data transmitted over the wire

## Exploring a link definition

Runtime links are typically defined in [Wadm deployment manifests](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/). Here is an example of a definition for a link from a component (importing on the `keyvalue` interface) to a provider (exporting on the same interface):

```yaml {7-17}
components:
  - name: http-component
    type: component
    properties:
      image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
    traits:
      - type: link
        properties:
          name: foo
          target: kvredis
          namespace: wasi
          package: keyvalue
          interfaces: [store]
          target_config:
            - name: redis-url
              properties:
                url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
```

**A link is always defined as a trait of the source**&mdash;that is, the importer. In addition to a target, the link definition has properties including...

- `name`, an optional unique identifier for this link which can be used to distinguish between [different usages of the same interface](#defining-and-using-link-names). If not specified, this value is `default`.
- `target`, which specifies the name of the exporting entity to be called
- `namespace`, which in the example above refers to `wasi`
- `package`, which specifies the particular interface group used
- `interfaces`, which lists specific `store` interface from `wasi-keyvalue`
- `target_config`, defining configuration data to pass to a provider

When a provider acts as a source rather than a target, it can instead take a `source_config` field. You can find configuration options for first-party providers in the [repositories for the specific providers in GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates).

You can use the [wit2wadm](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend/wit2wadm) tool to automatically generate a Wadm deployment manifest for a given component.

## What can I link with a component?

In wasmCloud, components may be linked to...

### Built-in providers

The wasmCloud host provides several functions available for import by components through built-in providers:

- Logging (using the [`wasi-logging`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging) interface)
- Random (using the [`wasi-random`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-random) interface)
- Clocks (using the [`wasi-clocks`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks) interface)

For example, the wasmCloud host's built-in logging function could satisfy a component's logging import. Built-in providers form wasmCloud's **trusted compute base**&mdash;they represent highly-vetted code that provides basic, commonly-used functionalities.

To use a built-in provider, you need _only_ include the import in a component's `world.wit` and call it using the WASI interface in question. It is not necessary to include built-in providers in a deployment manifest&mdash;since they are already present on any wasmCloud host, the host will fulfill the imports automatically.

<details>
<summary>Example: Logging</summary>

Generate a new Rust project:

```shell
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-rust
```

Add logging to the project's `world.wit` file in the `wit` directory:

```wit
package wasmcloud:hello;

world hello {
  import wasi:logging/logging@0.1.0-draft; // [!code ++]

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.2;
}
```

Update the Rust code to add a logging message:

```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!();

use exports::wasi::http::incoming_handler::Guest;
use wasi::http::types::*;

struct HttpServer;

impl Guest for HttpServer {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, response_out: ResponseOutparam) {
        // Add logging // [!code ++:6]
        wasi::logging::logging::log(
            wasi::logging::logging::Level::Info,
            "",
            &format!("Hello to your logs from Rust"),
        );
        let response = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        response.set_status_code(200).unwrap();
        let response_body = response.body().unwrap();
        response_body
            .write()
            .unwrap()
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n")
            .unwrap();
        OutgoingBody::finish(response_body, None).expect("failed to finish response body");
        ResponseOutparam::set(response_out, Ok(response));
    }
}

export!(HttpServer);
```

Remember: it is not necessary to include built-in providers in a deployment manifest.

Launch a local wasmCloud host with `wash up` and deploy:

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

When you invoke the component with `curl localhost:8080`, in addition to an HTTP response you will see a log message:

```shell
INFO handle_invocation{params=IncomingHttpHandle component_id="http_hello_world-http_component" component_ref="file:///Users/user/wasmcloud/wip/linking/logtest/build/http_hello_world_s.wasm"}:log: wasmcloud_host::wasmbus::handler: Hello to your logs from Rust component_id="http_hello_world-http_component" level=Level::Info context=""
```

</details>

### Other components

A component may be linked to another component at runtime (over the [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice)) or [build (via composition)](/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-build).

Linking components at runtime is a two-step process:

1. Imports and exports must be declared in the components' `world.wit`.
2. Links must be defined in your Wadm deployment manifest.

<details>
<summary>Example: Two Components</summary>

Here is an example manifest for an example application comprised of two components and an http-server provider:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: http-hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.2
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo in Rust, using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the component
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: pong-component
            namespace: example
            package: pong
            interfaces: [pingpong]

    - name: pong-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://../pong/virt.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the component
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1

    # Add a capability provider that enables HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.26.0
      traits:
        # Link the httpserver to the component, and configure the HTTP server
        # to listen on port 8000 for incoming requests
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  address: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

- The http-component is **exporting on the wasi-http interface** and **importing on a custom "pingpong" interface**. It is the importer in relation to the pong-component, so it is the source for that link.
- The pong-component is **exporting on the custom "pingpong" interface**. This is its only link relationship, and it is the exporter, so no links are defined as a trait of pong-component.
- The httpserver provider is **importing on the wasi-http interface**. It is the importer in relation to http-component, so it is the source for that link, and basic configuration is performed in the `source_config`.

If you would like to build and run the example described by this manifest, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the [composition example readme](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/composition).

Remember that the [wit2wadm](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend/wit2wadm) tool is available to help you automatically generate a Wadm deployment manifest for a given component. Because it extrapolates link definitions from a component's WIT interfaces, it can be very helpful for not only generating manifests but understanding linking relationships in your application.

</details>

### Providers

[Providers](/docs/concepts/providers) are longer-lived host plugins which may facilitate connections to external resources. A component may be linked at runtime to a provider, which may be running either on the same wasmCloud host or another host on the lattice.

A provider only ever dispatches messages to&mdash;or receives messages from&mdash;components. When a link is established for a particular component, the provider can remember that component's identity and use it for subsequent dispatches. As a result, the only information a linked provider needs is the component's identity. This identity is typically used for managing specific resources on behalf of the component, such as database connections, open TCP sockets, etc.

<details>
<summary>Example: Unpacking the Quickstart</summary>

The wasmCloud Quickstart (running through the "Adding capabilities" section) provides a great example of a component using two different providers. The component you build in the tutorial exports on the **wasi-http** interface (linking with the `http-server` provider) and imports on the **wasi-keyvalue** interface (linking with the `kvredis` provider).

Here's the manifest for the [Customize and Extend](/docs/tour/customize-and-extend/) step of the [Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world.mdx) example:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    # The component with our business logic
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        # This field can also point to artifacts in OCI registries
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
        # Link definition for http-component -> kvredis
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: kvredis
            namespace: wasi
            package: keyvalue
            interfaces: [atomics, store]
            target_config:
              - name: redis-url
                properties:
                  url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    # The kvredis provider
    - name: kvredis
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/keyvalue-redis:0.28.2
    # The httpserver provider
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.26.0
      traits:
        # Link definition for httpserver -> http-component
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  address: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

- The http-component is **importing functions on the keyvalue interface**. It is the **importer** in relation to **kvredis**, meaning that it is the source for the link definition: the link is defined as a trait of http-component.

- The http-component is **exposing a function on the http interface**. It is the **exporter** in relation to the **http-server** provider&mdash;in this case, the http-server provider is the source and the http-component is the target.

- Both the kvredis and httpserver providers are configured in the link definition, using a `target_config` field (if the provider is the target) or a `source_config` field (if the provider is the source).

Remember that the [wit2wadm](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend/wit2wadm) tool is available to help you automatically generate a Wadm deployment manifest for a given component. Because it extrapolates link definitions from a component's WIT interfaces, it can be very helpful for not only generating manifests but understanding linking relationships in your application.

## Defining and using link names

In some cases, you may wish to assign names to links. This can be useful when a source component needs to use the same interface with different configurations under different circumstances.

- For example, a component may use the `wasi:keyvalue` interface to link to both a local key-value cache for ephemeral storage and a cloud-based store for more resilient storage.
- In this example, you're using the same key-value interface and the same operations, but the interface needs to be configured differently. These different configurations of the interface can be differentiated with a link name.

Link names can be set [imperatively with the `wash link put` command](/docs/cli/wash#wash-link) or [declaratively via Wadm manifest](#exploring-a-link-definition), but are typically easiest to manage from a manifest. Link names are an optional field in a link definition and default to the value `default` if not specified. Below is an excerpt of a manifest defining names for two differently configured links:

```yaml
- type: link
  properties:
    name: foo
    target: your_provider_or_component
    namespace: wasi
    package: keyvalue
    interfaces: [store]
    target_config:
      # foo configuration
- type: link
  properties:
    name: bar
    target: your_provider_or_component
    namespace: wasi
    package: keyvalue
    interfaces: [store]
    target_config:
      # bar configuration
```

Once a link name is defined, in your component or provider's code, you can use [wasmCloud's `wasmcloud:bus` interface](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/wit/bus.wit) to make a call to a target by link name. You can include the `wasmcloud:bus` interface by importing the interface in your top-level world:

```wit
world component {
  import wasmcloud:bus/lattice@1.0.0;
}
```

Below are snippets of sample code that use different link names across languages supported by wasmCloud:

```rust
let yourinterface = wasmcloud::bus::lattice::CallTargetInterface::new(

wasmcloud::bus::lattice::set_link_name("foo", vec![yourinterface]);

```

## Designed for flexibility at runtime

Links are first-class citizens of a [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). A link can be declared (or removed) _before or after_ any of the parties of that link are running. Each time a provider is started, it is provided with a list of pre-existing links. Additionally, the provider is notified whenever a new link is declared, or an existing link is removed.

The ability to update links at runtime is a powerful feature of wasmCloud. There are several scenarios where this is useful, including:

- Swapping to an alternate provider implementation, such as an in-memory cache vs. an external data store.
- Upgrading a provider, or failing over to a backup provider.
- Routing requests to a provider running with specific characteristics, such as locality or configuration.

Runtime links can be created **imperatively** using the `wash` CLI, which can be helpful for development workflows and use-cases such as those above. See the [`wash link` subcommand documentation](/docs/cli/wash#wash-link) for more information.

:::note
"Order of operations" doesn't matter in runtime linking: while configuring an [application](/docs/concepts/applications), low-level commands to set links and start resources can arrive in any order. Additionally, all providers must treat messages to set/remove links as idempotent.
