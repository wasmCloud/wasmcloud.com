## Overview

Applications combine all of the previous concepts into a declarative, deployable unit. 

Applications are the primary abstraction for deployable workloads in a wasmCloud [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). Applications are declared, versioned, and defined using **application manifests**. Manifests conform to the [OAM manifest standard](https://oam.dev/) and may be written in YAML or JSON. 

Once deployed, applications are represented as **models** in the **wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (Wadm)**. An application model may include multiple deployable versions. Model persistence is decoupled from deployments themselves and from any particular host.

:::info[Compared to Kubernetes...]

A **wasmCloud application** is analogous to a **Kubernetes Deployment**.

### Application manifests

wasmCloud application manifests are composed of two sections: metadata and `spec`. 

* The metadata contains the application's name, version, and description. 
* The `spec` contains a list of the application's components and providers, each of which can have `traits`. Traits define configuration for the component, links, and how the component should be deployed. Examples of deployment traits include:

- run a single instance on a specific host `foo`
- run `N` instances on each host in the lattice
- 80% on hosts with label `foo`, 20% on hosts with label `bar`

The following is an example of a simple wasmCloud application manifest:

```yaml
# Metadata
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        # Run components from OCI registries as below or from a local .wasm component binary.
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/http-hello-world:0.1.0
      traits:
        # One replica of this component will run
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
    # The httpserver capability provider, started from the official wasmCloud OCI artifact
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.20.0
      traits:
        # Link the HTTP server and set it to listen on the local machine's port 8080
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080
```

:::[Write less YAML]
The design of WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) interfaces makes it possible to automate the generation of a manifest for a given component. Use the [`wit2wadm`](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend/wit2wadm) tool to quickly generate manifests from your components on the command line.

### wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)

Application deployment and management is handled by the **wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)**, a part of the wasmCloud platform that uses a control loop to react to events and reconcile requested state with desired state.

For an in-depth guide on how wasmCloud manages applications, see [wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).

:::info[Imperative or declarative?]
While wasmCloud supports the imperative management of [components](/docs/concepts/components), [providers](/docs/concepts/providers), and [links](/docs/concepts/linking-components/) (which can be useful for experimentation or debuggging), these are generally considered low-level operations. Declarative application management is generally better-suited to complex distributed applications that can be dynamically adjusted at runtime.
:::

Application models are stored in a NATS key-value bucket and persist beyond a particular host. For more information on how Wadm handles models, see the [reference for the Wadm API](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/ecosystem/wadm/api).
