## Overview

Production applications often require secrets at runtime to access internal or external systems. wasmCloud provides first-class support for secrets in distributed environments.

Secrets in wasmCloud are treated as a special piece of configuration. Secrets are stored in encrypted and secure stores; the host retrieves secrets from a secrets backend and provides them to components and providers that request them. Secrets backends are reachable by hosts via NATS using known NATS subject prefixes. Each secrets backend satisfies a common API so that anyone can write a backend and add an implementation to their cluster.

:::info[Compared to Kubernetes...]
wasmCloud's secrets support is similar to the Kubernetes [Secrets Store CSI driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/concepts.html#provider-for-the-secrets-store-csi-driver), rather than the core Secrets API. Secrets are fetched from external stores and are encrypted in transit using [**xkeys**](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_callout#encryption)&mdash;x25519 keypairs compatible with [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/) Seal and Open operations&mdash;and only ever stored in-memory using the Rust [`secrecy` crate](https://crates.io/crates/secrecy).
:::

## When to use secrets

In wasmCloud, secrets should be used for sensitive data that should never be stored in plaintext. Anytime your application needs an API key, password, token, or otherwise protected data, you should use a secret instead of embedding that into your application. By design, secrets are never logged or accessible in-memory, and when they are dropped they are wiped in-memory. The host has a means to fetch the secret on behalf of a component or provider, but not to use it itself.

## How secrets work in wasmCloud

Secrets support requires **wasmCloud 1.1** or higher. Utilizing secrets requires:

- A secrets backend (for example, the [NATS KV secrets backend](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/secrets-nats-kv) or the [Vault secrets backend](https://github.com/wasmCloud/contrib/tree/main/secrets/secrets-vault))
- A secret in the relevant secret store
- A component to consume the secret using the WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) secrets API, or a capability provider to receive the secret at runtime
- A secret definition scoped for the relevant usage (entity-scoped or link-scoped) in the wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm) application manifest

The complete path of a request for a secret is illustrated in this diagram:

![diagram](../../static/docs/images/secrets-diagram.png)

- When a component starts with a secret requirement, the host forms a request for the secret.
- The request is passed to the wasmCloud host's secrets handler, which resolves the secret reference and requests the secret from the proper secrets backend process.
- The secrets backend mediates with a secrets store&mdash;in the pictured examples, that might be a completely external store like Vault or the key-value store already available as part of NATS.
- A component makes a request for a named secret (`my-secret`) using the `get` function of the `wasmcloud:secrets` interface, and the host provides the secret resource to the component.
- A component reveals a secret by calling the `reveal` function on the secret resource.

## Defining secrets in application manifests

Components and providers must specify which secrets they require as part of their manifest definitions. A secret can be defined in two different places: at the top level of a component or a provider, at the same level as config, or in the configuration of a link. This gives us the opportunity to distinguish between the two contexts and have the host merge them together as needed.

In order to support providing additional backend-specific information in the application manifest, we use the policies draft specification from the Open Application Model (OAM). These are defined in the application manifest at the top level under `spec`. See below for examples.

### Entity-scoped secrets

An entity-scoped secret is a secret that is defined at the top level of a component or provider. This means that the secret is available in any function defined by a component, including those that are implemented to handle a specific interface attached to a link. This is useful for secrets that are used across multiple interfaces or functions.

```yaml
spec:
  policies:
    # Policy for vault, including role name and mount path
    - name: vault
      type: policy.secret.wasmcloud.dev/v1alpha1
      properties:
        backend: 'vault'
        role_name: 'demo-role'
        mount_path: 'jwt'
    # Policy for aws-secrets-manager, including IAM role
    - name: aws-secrets-manager
      type: policy.secret.wasmcloud.dev/v1alpha1
      properties:
        backend: 'aws-secrets-manager'
        iam_role: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/demo-role'
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/test-fetch-with-token:0.1.0-fake
        secrets:
          # wasmCloud will fetch this secret from the vault backend
          - name: some-api-token
            properties:
              policy: vault
              key: secrets/test/value
              version: 1
          # wasmCloud will fetch this secret from the aws-secrets-manager backend
          - name: my-other-secret
            properties:
              policy: aws-secrets-manager
              key: secret-name
              version: 'be01a5fb-7ebb-4ae9-8ea0-0902e8940bc0'
```

### Link-scoped secrets

A link-scoped secret is only accessible in the context of a link. For a component, this means that it is only available in the functions that are implemented to handle the interfaces that defined by the link. For a provider, this means that is supplied when the link is created. This is intended for secrets such as database connection strings, API tokens, etc, that are needed in the context of a component communicating with another component or a provider. An example of what this looks like is shown below:

```yaml
- type: link
  properties:
    namespace: wasmcloud
    package: postgres
    interfaces: [managed-query]
    target:
      name: sql-postgres
      secrets:
        - name: db-password
          properties:
            policy: vault
            key: secrets/myapp/db-password
            version: 1
```

### Sample manifest

Below is a sample manifest (from the [secrets example in the wasmCloud monorepo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/security/secrets)) that shows how secrets can be defined in a wasmCloud application:

```yaml

                  properties:
                    address: 0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Defining secrets on the command line

Secrets can also be defined on the command line using the `wash` CLI. This is useful for testing and development purposes. The `wash secrets` command allows you to define secrets in the same way as in the application manifest, and operates similarly to the `wash config` command. Additional properties can be supplied with the `--property` flag which is the equivalent of using the `policy` field in the application manifest.

Note that the `wash secrets` command is meant to define secret configuration that the host can use to fetch secrets from a secrets backend. It does not actually store the secret itself.

```bash
# wash secrets put <name> <backend> <key> --version <version> --property <property>...
wash secrets put my-secret vault secrets/test/value \
  --version 1 \
  --property role_name=demo-role \
  --property mount_path=jwt
```

This will create a configuration called `SECRET_my-secret`. When you start your component, provider, or link, simply supply the named configuration `SECRET_<secret-name>` in the configuration field. For example:

```bash
wash start component ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0 \
  hello-world \
  --config SECRET_my-secret
```

To retrieve a secret configuration from the config store, use the `wash secrets get` command:

```bash
wash secrets get my-secret
```

## Using secrets

:::warning
wasmCloud ensures that secrets are never logged, stored, or transmitted in plaintext. However, if you `reveal` a secret in a component or a capability provider, it is your responsibility to handle the secret securely.

For example, if you reveal a secret in a component and then log it or use the secret value as an argument to a different function, the secret may be exposed in logs or over the NATS network. Be sure to handle secrets securely in your code.
:::

### Components

Components access secrets using the [`wasmcloud:secrets`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/crates/runtime/wit/deps/secret/secrets.wit) WIT interface. Support is built into the wasmCloud host to fetch secrets from a secrets backend and provide them to components at runtime.

Ensure you have the `wasmcloud:secrets` interface in your component's WIT world:

```wit
package wasmcloud:example;

world component {
  import wasmcloud:secrets/store@0.1.0-draft;
  import wasmcloud:secrets/reveal@0.1.0-draft;
}
```

{/* TODO: Use this example, or an equivalent, for each component language */}

```rust
fn is_allowed(provided_password: String) -> bool {
    // Resource secret, not actually loaded
    let password = wasmcloud::secrets::store::get("api_password").expect("failed to get password");

    // Revealed secret
    match wasmcloud::secrets::reveal::reveal(&password) {
        wasmcloud::secrets::store::SecretValue::String(s) => s == provided_password,
        wasmcloud::secrets::store::SecretValue::Bytes(b) => String::from_utf8_lossy(&b) == provided_password,
    }
}
```

### Capability Providers

Providers access secrets by receiving them at startup time and at link time. At start time wasmCloud will give the capability provider a pair of encryption keys that are generated on-the-fly for this specific host and provider pair, and will use these keys to send the secrets to the provider. The provider can then decrypt the secrets using the same keys. This is all done transparently to the provider developer and is handled by the wasmCloud provider SDKs.

## Example: Using a NATS KV backend

This is an example of an application that has a capability provider and component that refer to a secret value. The secret itself is encrypted and stored in a [NATS KV secrets backend](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/secrets-nats-kv) instance, and wasmCloud fetches this secret at runtime based on the signed identity of the component/provider.

This example is a modified version of the [http-keyvalue-counter](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-keyvalue-counter) application that authenticates with a Redis database that requires a password, and serves an HTTP API that requires an authentication password header.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [wash 0.30.0 or newer](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)
- [secrets-nats-kv](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/secrets-nats-kv) installed

Clone this repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud.git
cd wasmCloud
```

### Running this example

Build the keyvalue counter auth component, and the keyvalue redis auth provider:

```bash
wash build -p component-keyvalue-counter-auth
wash build -p provider-keyvalue-redis-auth
```

Run the example docker compose for the necessary infrastructure, generating secret keys:

```bash
export ENCRYPTION_XKEY_SEED=$(wash keys gen curve -o json | jq -r '.seed')
export TRANSIT_XKEY_SEED=$(wash keys gen curve -o json | jq -r '.seed')
docker compose up -d
```

Place the necessary secrets in the NATS KV backend:

```bash
# Ensure the TRANSIT_XKEY_SEED is still exported in your environment above
# or the decryption of the secret will fail
secrets-nats-kv put api_password --string opensesame
secrets-nats-kv put redis_password --string sup3rS3cr3tP4ssw0rd
# You can also put the password using an environment variable
SECRET_STRING_VALUE=sup3rS3cr3tP4ssw0rd secrets-nats-kv put default_redis_password
```

Allow your component and provider to access these secrets at runtime (this is a NATS KV backend specific step, other secrets backends like Vault will handle authorization externally with policies):

```bash
component_key=$(wash inspect ./component-keyvalue-counter-auth/build/component_keyvalue_counter_auth_s.wasm -o json | jq -r '.component')
provider_key=$(wash inspect ./provider-keyvalue-redis-auth/build/wasmcloud-example-auth-kvredis.par.gz -o json | jq -r '.service')
secrets-nats-kv add-mapping $component_key --secret api_password
secrets-nats-kv add-mapping $provider_key --secret redis_password --secret default_redis_password
```

Lastly, run wasmCloud and deploy the application:

```bash
WASMCLOUD_SECRETS_TOPIC=wasmcloud.secrets \
    WASMCLOUD_ALLOW_FILE_LOAD=true \
    NATS_CONNECT_ONLY=true \
    wash up --detached
```

```bash
wash app deploy ./wadm.yaml
```

You can check the status of your application by running `wash app list`. Once it's deployed, you can make requests to the application.

### Making authenticated requests

You can first verify that unauthenticated requests to Redis and the component are denied:

```bash
➜ redis-cli -u redis://127.0.0.1:6379 keys '*'
(error) NOAUTH Authentication required.

➜ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/counter
Unauthorized
```

Then, authenticating passes the check in the component:

```bash
➜ curl -H "password: opensesame" 127.0.0.1:8080/counter
Counter /counter: 1
```

Passing in an invalid password will still fail the authentication check:

```bash
➜ curl -H "password: letmein" 127.0.0.1:8080/counter
Unauthorized
```

If you want to inspect the Redis database directly, you can provide the password in the URI:

```bash
redis-cli -u redis://sup3rS3cr3tP4ssw0rd@127.0.0.1:6379 get /counter
```

### Cleanup

When finished with this example, simply shutdown wasmCloud and the resources running in Docker:

```bash
wash down
docker compose down
```
## Secret flow

The diagrams below illustrate secrets flow across common use-cases.

### Start component with secret
