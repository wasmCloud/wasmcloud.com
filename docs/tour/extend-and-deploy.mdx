In our previous tutorials, we started a developer loop and added two [**interfaces**](/docs/concepts/interfaces.mdx) (`wasi:logging` and `wasi:keyvalue`) to our application. The `wash dev` process satisfied our application's capability requirements automatically, so we could move quickly and focus on code.

Now we'll learn how to:

- Explore capabilities available for wasmCloud applications
- Extend our application by plugging in capability requirements
- Deploy an application in a local wasmCloud environment

:::info[Prerequisites]
This tutorial assumes you're following directly from the previous steps. Make sure to complete [**Quickstart**](/docs/tour/hello-world.mdx) and [**Add Features**](/docs/tour/add-features.mdx) first.

## Choose a capability

As we learned in the previous tutorial, components can make use of **capabilities** for common requirements like key-value storage or logging.

If we want to learn about a capability, we can browse the [**Capability Catalog**](/docs/capabilities/index.mdx).

Each capability in the catalog consists of an [interface](/docs/concepts/interfaces.mdx) and one or more [capability providers](/docs/concepts/providers.mdx).

- **Interfaces** are the language-agnostic APIs we use to represent a capability in our code. They are defined using the WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) interface description language in simple `.wit` files.
- **Capability providers** are reusable executable plugins that deliver functionality described by an interface. Where interfaces are typically very general (i.e. key-value storage), providers are tool- or vendor-specific implementations (i.e. Redis, Vault).

Here's the Capability Catalog listing for **Key-Value Storage**:

| NAME              | INTERFACE                                                       | PROVIDERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key-Value Storage | [`wasi:keyvalue`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue) | [Redis](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages/container/package/keyvalue-redis), [NATS](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages/container/package/keyvalue-nats), [Vault](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages/container/package/keyvalue-vault) |

Here we find the interface, `wasi:keyvalue`, and several capability providers including Redis.

:::info[What's WASI?]
WASI stands for [**WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)**](https://wasi.dev/), a group of standards-track APIs governed by the WASI Subgroup in the W3C WebAssembly Community Group. wasmCloud uses WASI interfaces to define capabilities in a standards-based way that avoids vendor lock-in.For more on interfaces and WASI, see the [Interfaces](/docs/developer/interfaces/creating-an-interface) page in our [Developer Guide](/docs/category/developer-guide).
:::

### Select a capability provider

Interfaces are backed by capability providers, which are both reusable and swappable.

When we ran `wash dev`, we added capabilities&mdash;but we never specified tools or libraries for key-value storage and logging. `wash dev` provisioned appropriate **capability providers** automatically. How? Because components encode their dependencies in the binaries themselves, `wash dev` was able to detect the requirement at runtime and start an appropriate providers to satisfy the requirements for an HTTP server, key-value store, and logger.

So what was actually running? In this case, `wash dev` used:

- [The wasmCloud `httpserver` provider](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages/container/package/http-server)
- [The wasmCloud built-in logger](/docs/concepts/providers#built-in-providers)
- [The NATS `keyvalue` provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pkgs/container/keyvalue-nats) (Convenient since NATS is already part of the wasmCloud stack)

As far as the key-value capability is concerned, the application looks like this:

![wash dev diagram](../images/quickstart-diagram-1.png)

If `wash dev` is still running from the previous tutorial, make sure to stop it with CTRL+C.

For our manual deployment, let's **swap out a different key-value storage provider**. We'll use the [Redis provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/provider-keyvalue-redis), which will only require us to have `redis-server` or Docker installed. The Redis provider will mediate a connection to the Redis server, which is running external to wasmCloud.

<Tabs groupId="env" queryString>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local Redis Server" default>

[Install](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) and launch the local redis server in the background

```bash
redis-server &
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

Launch a Redis container in the background.

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

On the [wasmCloud GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages?repo_name=wasmCloud), we can find a [`keyvalue-redis` image](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pkgs/container/keyvalue-redis) (also linked in the Capability Catalog) that enables us to deploy the provider:

```text
ghcr.io/wasmcloud/keyvalue-redis:0.28.1
```

:::note[What are those images?]
The wasmCloud ecosystem uses the [OCI image specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) to package components and providers&mdash;these component and provider images are not container images, but conform to OCI standards and may be stored on any OCI-compatible registry.
:::

### Deploying the application with a key-value provider

First, let's start a local wasmCloud environment in "detached" mode so we can keep working in our terminal:

```shell
wash up -d
```

Instead of the default NATS `keyvalue` provider used by `wash dev`, we want to use the Redis provider:

![manual deploy diagram](../images/quickstart-diagram-2.png)

To deploy a wasmCloud application manually, we use an [**application manifest**](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model) written in YAML, much like a Kubernetes manifest.

This `.yaml` file defines the relationships between the components and providers that make up our application, along with other important configuration details. It is conventionally named `wadm.yaml` after the [**wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager**](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/index.md) that handles scheduling.

We can modify our `wadm.yaml` to include the Redis provider and match the diagram above.

Open `wadm.yaml` in your code editor and make the changes below.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        # Your manifest will point to the path of the built component, you can also
        # start published components from OCI registries
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
        # The new key-value link configuration # [!code ++:11]
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: kvredis
            namespace: wasi
            package: keyvalue
            interfaces: [atomics, store]
            target_config:
              - name: redis-url
                properties:
                  url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    # The new capability provider # [!code ++:5]
    - name: kvredis
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/keyvalue-redis:0.28.1
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.22.0
      traits:
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  address: 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Once you save `wadm.yaml`, we can deploy from the project directory:

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

Check the status of the app:

```shell
wash app list
```

**Note**: When deploying the application, it uses port **8080** as defined in `wadm.yaml`.

Once the application status is `Deployed`, we can `curl` the application like before:

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080?name=Bob'
```

```text
Hello x1, Bob!
```

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080?name=Bob'
```

```text
Hello x2, Bob!
```

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080?name=Alice'
```

```text
Hello x1, Alice!
```

Note that our increments are starting over again&mdash;after all, we swapped out the dev key-value store for a totally different one!

When you're done with the application, delete it from the wasmCloud environment:

```shell
wash app delete hello-world
```

Shut down the environment:

```shell
wash down
```

## Log files

If you encounter any problems, wasmCloud log files may contain useful error messages, and it's good to know how to find them. The tabs below, organized by how you started the wasmCloud environment, show you where to find logs:

<Tabs groupId="env" queryString >
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

By default, logs from `wash up` are automatically output to your terminal. If you ran the command
with the `--detached` flag, logs can be found in `~/.wash/downloads/wasmcloud.log`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

Logs from hosts running in Docker, if started with our docker compose, can be found by running
`docker logs wasmcloud`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

In this tutorial, we learned how to explore capabilities, swap out a provider, and deploy an application to a wasmCloud environment.

- For more information on defining application manifests, see our documentation on the [wasmCloud application deployment manager](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).
- For more information on capabilities, such as how to create new interfaces and providers, see the Developer Guide pages for [providers](/docs/developer/providers/) and [interfaces](/docs/developer/interfaces/creating-an-interface).

You can continue to build on this application by adding more features, or you can explore additional first-party providers in the [**Capability Catalog**](/docs/capabilities/index.mdx) to get an idea of what is possible with wasmCloud.

The next page demonstrates scaling via application manifest and gives a high-level overview of why this application that you've built already eliminates complexity and pain that developers often face when building applications for the cloud.
