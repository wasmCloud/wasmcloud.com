In the previous steps, we started a developer loop, added two [**interfaces**](/docs/concepts/interfaces.mdx) (`wasi:logging` and `wasi:keyvalue`), and extended our application with pluggable [**capabilities**](/docs/concepts/capabilities.mdx).

Now we'll learn how to:

- Declaratively deploy an application in a local wasmCloud environment
- Scale an application to handle multiple parallel requests
- Distribute an application globally
- Use the wasmCloud dashboard

:::info[Prerequisites]
This tutorial assumes you're following directly from the previous steps. Make sure to complete [**Quickstart**](/docs/tour/hello-world.mdx), [**Add Features**](/docs/tour/add-features.mdx), and [**Customize and Extend**](/docs/tour/customize-and-extend/) first.
:::

### Declaratively deploying the application

We will continue to use the Redis key-value capability provider as in the [Customize and Extend](/docs/tour/customize-and-extend/) step, but this time we will specify the provider using a declarative [**application manifest**](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model) written in YAML, much like a Kubernetes manifest.

This `.yaml` file defines the relationships between the components and providers that make up our application, along with other important configuration details. It is conventionally named `wadm.yaml` after the [**wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager**](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/index.md) that handles scheduling.

We can modify our `wadm.yaml` to include the Redis provider.

Open `wadm.yaml` in your code editor and make the changes below.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world # [!code ++:3]
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        # Your manifest will point to the path of the built component; you can also
        # start published components from OCI registries
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
        # The new key-value link configuration # [!code ++:11]
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: kvredis
            namespace: wasi
            package: keyvalue
            interfaces: [atomics, store]
            target_config:
              - name: redis-url
                properties:
                  url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    # The new capability provider # [!code ++:5]
    - name: kvredis
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/keyvalue-redis:0.28.2
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.26.0
      traits:
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  address: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

* `kvredis` is defined as a `capability` provider and fetched from an OCI image.
* `http-component` connects to `kvredis` via a runtime `link`.
    - The **link definition** specifies the interface and configuration through which the component and provider will communicate.

Save your changes to `wadm.yaml`.

## Scaling up 📈

So far, our application can only handle a single request at a time. This is because only a single **instance** is defined for it in the application manifest as a property of the `spreadscaler`:

```yaml {14-16}
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
...
```

Following the specification in the manifest, wasmCloud instructs the [host](/docs/concepts/hosts.mdx)'s WebAssembly runtime ([wasmtime](/docs/ecosystem/wasmtime/)) to instantiate **only a single instance of our component** at any time to process incoming requests. As a result, requests received at the same time are processed sequentially, one after the other. 

Let's try adding a simple `sleep` to the handler to simulate a longer processing time:

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="Go">

```go

		return
	}

	logger.Info(fmt.Sprintf("Replying greeting 'Hello x%d, %s!'", *value.OK(), name)) // [!code ++]

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello x%d, %s!\n", *value.OK(), name)
}

// Since we don't run this program like a CLI, the `main` function is empty. Instead,
// we call the `handleRequest` function when an HTTP request is received.

:::note[Why are we adding a sleep period?]
The response time of our hello handler is very low. To show that requests are not processed in parallel, we need to ensure a longer response time, which we can exploit in our tests.
:::

Because we've made changes, run `wash build` to compile the updated Wasm component.

```bash
wash build
```

Start a local wasmCloud environment (using the `-d`/`--detached` flag to run in the background):

```shell
wash up -d
```

If you stopped the Redis server in the previous tutorial, start it up again: 

<Tabs groupId="env" queryString>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local Redis Server" default>

```shell
redis-server &
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```shell
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Manually deploy the application:

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

Now we'll try to send multiple requests in parallel.

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="Linux/macOS" label="Linux/macOS">

As you can see, only the first `curl` command receives the expected response in time, while all the others run into a timeout. However, if you check the logs of the wasmCloud host, you will see that multiple requests have been received and forwarded to our component one after the other.

```

:::note[Checking the `DEBUG` or `TRACE` logs of the wasmCloud host]
You can also check the wasmCloud host's `DEBUG` or `TRACE` logs for more detailed information (e.g. using `wash up --log-level=debug`). In these logs, you can clearly see that for received requests, our hello component is instantiated sequentially.
:::

If you wish, you can also use `wash spy` to check which messages the capability providers and the hello component have received and sent.

```bash
wash spy --experimental hello_world-http_component
```

:::note[Requests are not forwarded to our component anymore]
After multiple requests were received but timed out, it is no longer possible to send further requests to our hello application. The reason for this is that the httpserver capability provider is no longer able to invoke the hello component via NATS. To continue, we must first delete and redeploy our application.
:::

To receive multiple requests in parallel, we need to instruct wasmCloud to scale our component according to the incoming load. WebAssembly components can be easily scaled due to the small size and portability of the binaries as well as [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)'s ability to efficiently instantiate multiple instances of a given component. 

We leverage these aspects to make it simple to scale your applications with wasmCloud. Components only use resources when they're actively processing requests, so you can **specify the number of instances you want to run** and **wasmCloud will automatically scale up and down to meet demand**. 

Let's allow our application to scale up to 100 instances simultaneously by editing the application manifest in `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml {14-17}
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1 // [!code --]
            # Update the scale to 100 // [!code ++:2]
            instances: 100
...
```

Our application is ready to be deployed again with up to 100 instances, meaning it can handle up to 100 simultaneous incoming HTTP requests. 

Deploy the application again:

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

Now wasmCloud will be able to automatically scale the component according to the incoming load. Let's try sending multiple requests in parallel again.

:::note[Utilization planning is important]
As we've seen, if a component receives too many requests in parallel, it may break down and wasmCloud will not be able to forward further requests. Therefore, it is important to plan and manage the specified maximum number of concurrent instances for Spreadscaler components according to the expected load.
:::

When you're done with the application, delete it from the wasmCloud environment:

```shell
wash app delete hello-world
```

Shut down the environment:

```shell
wash down
```

## Distribute Globally 🌍

No matter where your components and capability providers run, they can seamlessly communicate on the [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). This means you can deploy your components to any cloud provider, edge location, or even on-premises and they will be able to communicate with each other. This is possible because wasmCloud uses [NATS](https://nats.io/) as its messaging layer, which is a lightweight, high-performance, and secure messaging system that can be deployed anywhere.

Distributing your application just requires updating your manifest to include spread information and making sure there are available wasmCloud hosts in the desired locations. We can update our hello application to run in multiple locations by editing `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml {17-27}
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 100
            # Ensure the component is spread across multiple zones
            # Of the 100 replicas, place 80% in us-east-1 and 20% in us-west-1
            spread:
              - name: eastcoast
                weight: 80
                requirements:
                  zone: us-east-1
              - name: westcoast
                weight: 20
                requirements:
                  zone: us-west-1
```

These requirements will ensure that 80% of the replicas are placed in `us-east-1` and 20% in `us-west-1`. You can specify any number of zones and weights to distribute your components across multiple locations. Each requirement matches directly with a [label](/docs/deployment/hosts/labels) that must be present on a host, and your currently launched host doesn't have any specified labels. Let's launch two more hosts with the required labels, and then deploy our new application.

:::info
If you already deployed your application, it will be placed in the `Failed` state because the requirements are not met. As soon as we launch the hosts with the required labels, the application will be automatically rescheduled.
:::

```bash
wash up --multi-local --label zone=us-east-1 -d
wash up --multi-local --label zone=us-west-1 -d
```

Just run `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` again, wasmCloud will be configured to automatically distribute your component across multiple locations based on the spread requirements. You can see all of your hosts and the components running on them by running `wash get inventory`.

## View the wasmCloud dashboard

You can start the wasmCloud dashboard using the `wash`.

```bash
wash ui
```

If you would like to change the port that the websocket is enabled on, you can pass the `--nats-websocket-port` option to `wash up`.
Note that you will need to stop NATS if it is already running or the new config will not apply. You can do this with `wash down --all` to stop everything.

```bash
wash up --nats-websocket-port 4444 # defaults to 4223
```

:::info[What will happen to my application?]
Treat wasmCloud hosts as commodity. Stopping your host will stop all of the components running on it, and **wadm** will look for other available hosts to reschedule your application on. As soon as you launch your new host with the `--nats-websocket-port` option, your application will be rescheduled on it and work just as it did before.
:::

Then, you can launch the wasmCloud dashboard using `wash ui`, which will launch the dashboard on [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).
This is a great way to visualize what is running on your host, even multiple hosts that are connected to the same NATS server.

## Summary

Now you've learned how to scale your applications with wasmCloud and distribute them across multiple locations. You can use this same approach to scale and distribute any wasmCloud application based on load and location requirements. Read on to the next page to learn more about the benefits of wasmCloud and how to continue to develop after this quickstart.
