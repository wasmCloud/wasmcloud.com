# Hello World

A familiar starting example to get you up and running with wasmCloud.

:::info

If you have not installed `wash`, follow the [installation guide](../installation/) first.

:::

In this guide, we'll be taking a tour through some of the most common activities in the wasmCloud
ecosystem like starting and configuring the two main components of wasmCloud: [actors](/docs/reference/glossary#actors) and
[capability providers](/docs/reference/glossary#capabilities). All wasmCloud applications need a [host](/docs/category/host-runtimes) to run on, so let's
use `wash` to start one now.

## Starting a Host

To start a host, simply run `wash up`. The default settings should work well for this tutorial. The host can be killed at any time with `CTRL+c`

This command does a lot behind the scenes, but most importantly it spins up 3 core processes:

- the **wasmCloud** host which manages the execution of actors and capability providers
- a [**NATS**](https://nats.io/) server to manage communications between application components
- a [**wadm**](/docs/category/declarative-application-deployment-wadm) process which monitors the [lattice](/docs/reference/glossary#lattice) and maintains the state of managed deployments

By default, `wash` will run the host in interactive mode.
If you'd rather run the host in the background, run `wash up --detached` (or `wash up -d`, for short).

## Generating a New Project

Now that our wasmCloud host is running, let's generate a new actor project. This is where our "Hello World" example begins. If you're running your host in the foreground, just switch to another terminal window to run these commands.

This command generates a new actor project in the `./hello` directory:

```shell
wash new actor -t hello hello
```

This actor is a simple Rust project with a few extra goodies included for wasmCloud. At a high level, the important pieces are:

1. `src/lib.rs`: Where the business logic is implemented
2. `wasmcloud.toml`: Actor metadata and capability permissions
3. `wadm.yaml`: A declarative manifest for running the full application

We'll take a look at each of these in depth later, but for now let's run the example.

## Starting our Application

We'll use `wash` and [wadm](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wadm), the wasmCloud application deployment manager, to start this actor, the httpserver capability, and link them together to configure them.

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

`wadm` will take care of taking this manifest and scheduling the resources on the host that you launched earlier. You should see output in the host logs when your actor and capability start up, and then you can query it yourself:

```shell
$ curl localhost:8080
Hello, world!
```

Congratulations, you just ran a WebAssembly application in wasmCloud!

## How does it work?

When you send your HTTP request to `localhost:8080`, that request is received by the HTTP Server capability provider. The HTTP Server capability provider then forwards that request to the actor, which responds with the string "Hello, world!". This loose coupling of capability providers and actors provides flexibility, security, and it lets our actor code be loosely coupled to non-functional requirements. Let's take a look at that code now in `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use wasmbus_rpc::actor::prelude::*;
use wasmcloud_interface_httpserver::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpServer, HttpServerReceiver};

#[derive(Debug, Default, Actor, HealthResponder)]
#[services(Actor, HttpServer)]
struct HelloActor {}

/// Implementation of the HttpServer capability contract
#[async_trait]
impl HttpServer for HelloActor {
    async fn handle_request(&self, _ctx: &Context, _req: &HttpRequest) -> RpcResult<HttpResponse> {
        Ok(HttpResponse::ok("Hello, World!"))
    }
}
```

This actor is set up to receive requests from the `HttpServer` capability, with a single function `handle_request` that matches what the capability provider expects. All you need to worry about as an applicaiton developer is what functional logic you want to apply when you receive an `HttpRequest`, and what `HttpResponse` you want to return. There's no mention of ports, certificates, HTTP libraries, and if those things change this actor will work all the same.

:::info

Capabilities are _deny by default_, and if you take a look in `wasmcloud.toml` you'll see the only capability is `wasmcloud:httpserver`. This means that this actor can never access files on disk, make network requests of its own, or even access the system time, it's blocked by the wasmCloud runtime.

:::

When you ran `wash app deploy wadm.yaml`, `wadm` takes the application manifest and schedules the components on hosts according to the scale you specify. This example has a minimal manifest, let's take a look at it:

```yaml
# Metadata
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "wasmCloud Hello World Example"
spec:
  components:
    # Your actor component, started from the wasmCloud example OCI artifact
    - name: hello
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/hello:0.1.7
      traits:
        # One replica of this actor will run
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        # The link configuration tells the httpserver to listen on 8080
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080

    # The httpserver capability provider, started from the official wasmCloud OCI artifact
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
```

## Scaling up 📈

WebAssembly can be easily scaled due to its small size, portability, and [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)'s ability to efficiently instantiate multiple instances of a single WebAssembly module. We leverage these aspects to make it simple to scale your applications with wasmCloud. Let's scale up our hello world application to 50 replicas by editing `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello
  annotations:
    # Make sure to bump the version so wadm knows to update the application
    version: v0.0.2
    description: "wasmCloud Hello World Example"
spec:
  components:
    - name: hello
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/hello:0.1.7
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            # Update the scale to 50
            replicas: 50
```

Now your hello application is ready to deploy v0.0.2 with 50 replicas. Just run `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` again, and you'll see the logs start flowing in. It's a little easier to visualize this in the wasmCloud dashboard, so let's take a look at that next.

## Viewing the wasmCloud dashboard

Open a browser tab to the URL [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). This is the
wasmCloud dashboard (or _washboard_), a GUI that you will use quite often as you learn to build distributed applications in
this ecosystem.

<img
  src={washboard_hello}
  width="800"
  alt="wasmCloud dashboard with hello world application"
/>

:::info

By default, wasmCloud hosts connect to port **4000**. If this port isn't available, you won't see
the wasmCloud dashboard. If you need to change the port number, you can set the environment variable
`WASMCLOUD_DASHBOARD_PORT` to a new number before starting a host.

:::

## Log files

If you encounter any problems, the host log files may contain useful error
messages, and it's good to know how to find them. The tabs below, organized by how you started the
wasmCloud host, show you where to find logs:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="wash-up" label="Wash Up" default>

By default, logs from `wash up` are automatically output to your terminal. If you ran the command
with the `--detached` flag, logs can be found in `~/.wash/downloads/wasmcloud_4000.log`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

Logs from hosts running in Docker, if started with our docker compose, can be found by running
`docker logs wasmcloud`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've made it through the first guide to wasmCloud. You started your first application and
got familiar with the fundamentals of `wash`, `wadm`, and the wasmCloud dashboard. You should now feel
comfortable exploring the ecosystem. We recommend proceeding onto the next guide, where you can build your own
application and get into the developer loop.
