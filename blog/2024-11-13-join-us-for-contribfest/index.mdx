We're thrilled to be hosting a [**Contribfest**](https://sched.co/1howS) session on **Thursday, November 14**, at KubeCon North America 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Check it out from **11:00am to 12:30pm MST** in the Salt Palace, Level 3, 355 D!

As a [newly Incubating CNCF project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/11/12/cncf-welcomes-wasmcloud-to-the-cncf-incubator/), there's never been a better time to jump on board and become an open source contributor. In this post, we'll explain exactly what Contribfest is, highlight some good first issues for new contributors, and show you how you can get involved, whether you're in Salt Lake City or anywhere around the world.

## What is Contribfest?

Contribfest gives attendees an opportunity to join project maintainers and community contributors to explore good first issues, hunt bugs, discuss improvements, and pair program with maintainers to contribute directly to CNCF projects.

At this year's wasmCloud Contribfest, maintainers including Cosmonic's **Bailey Hayes** and **Taylor Thomas,** and Adobe's **Colin Murphy** will be on hand to show users of all experience levels how to get involved with the wasmCloud project.

Whether you're just getting started with Wasm or you're ready to dive into what makes wasmCloud tick, you'll have the opportunity to get familiar with the wasmCloud developer experience and work alongside maintainers to be a part of this exciting and evolving project.
