### Q2 2025 Community Roadmap Planning

* Brooks reviews the status of previous roadmap items and proposed bringing in-progress items forward via the current pull requests.
* wasmCloud had 3,500 contributions last quarter!
* Brooks proposes recategorizing roadmap items into “Research,” “development,” and “first issue” in order to better represent the stage of readiness for each issue, streamline contribution, and avoid overly vague roadmap items. 
* Lucas suggests looking at bugs as thematic bundles with paired subject area experts and newer contributors, to better facilitate work and knowledge sharing. This can also help us tackle common problem areas that are generating a number of bugs. HTTP handling is a good example of this, with multiple issues to address.
* Prioritized roadmap items include HTTP bugs as discussed above, evolution of wash plugins, automatic washboard standup with `wash dev`, documentation for the new RPC error model, replacing the use of `~/.wash` with XDG Base Directory Specification, and more
* You can find the full roadmap (and comment with feedback and suggestions) at https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/14
