### Meeting Notes

Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone ❤️

#### DEMO: OTEL tracing, logs and metrics in wasmCloud 1.0

- We will have full support for traces, logs and metrics in wasmCloud 1.0 - this will be an important moment as most organizations are looking for platforms to meet, what are often called, the 3 pillars of observability.
- wasmCloud has had support for distributed traces for a while. Part of the approach is that the observability in wasmCloud should be compatible with your existing tools—drop wasmCloud into an existing system and you can observe it.
- Grafana for dashboards, collectors, Loki for collecting logs, Prometheus for collecting metrics and Tempo for collecting traces.
- This should something you can get for free out of the box. You should not have to import a trace library to orchestrate your apps - it should happen automatically. This is what we’ve tried to achieve in wasmCloud 1.0!
- Exporting to OTEL compatible collectors - if you are not familiar with the project [OTEL is a standard](https://opentelemetry.io/) collection of APIs, SDKs and tools that are commonly used across the tech ecosystem.
- It is a highly contributed project in CNCF (right behind K8s) very well maintained and supported.
- On the wasmCloud side we will automate much of the functionality - including language support.
- In the example we can see a Docker compose OTEL manifest inc. Grafana for dashboards, collectors, Loki for collecting logs, Prometheus for collecting metrics and Tempo for collecting traces.
- Take a look a the recording for a demo showing how this works in wasmCloud!

#### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud 0.82, the final countdown

- In the final leg in the journey to wasmCloud 1.0, we are releasing Release candidate 0.82 going through testing. Couple of changes to docs; essentially, we will lean into writing Wasm apps with components.
- In the [QuickStart section](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) in wasmCloud docs, we have dropped Rust in favour of Wasm components in a range of languages.
- New in 0.82 version — more first class support for generating component atcor projects in specific languages.
- Templates are available for Rust, Typescript, TinyGo, Python.
- We will also land one of Victor’s awesome features - relative paths in a Wadm manifest. Has been a sore point in onboarding which we wanted to solve. We’ve removed the requirement to modify a wadm manifest unless you want to add capabilities.
- WIT worlds will be pinned to the WASI 0.2 interfaces (http, CLI). It’s worth calling attention to 0.82 is the version of wasmCloud that will drop with WASI 0.2 support.
- We’re eager to hear your sticking points - hot reload, declarative dev experience, changing code, auto-reload etc. All feedback welcome on what your dev loop looks like and what you’d want to see.
- Please go through the tutorial and let us know if you find any issues or need improvements.

#### DISCUSSION: Roadmap update

- Roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/8).
- About to start on removing capability claim signing.
- Formalizing Wasm control interface is now almost complete
- Capability providers are now all working on WIT definitions and we will use WIT for all actor/providers going forward.
- After 0.82 we can begin on final tasks.
- We are making very steady progress as we near the release of 1.0.
- Liam: Are there many breaking change - what are you thoughts on release candidates - what’s in your mind?
  - When it comes to releasing wasmCloud 0.82 this is the last planned minor release of wasmCloud before 1.0 because it has all the important things other than the wRPC framework. When we look at major features. Many of the changes are ones we way to make but we don’t want to break everything before then.
  - We plan to keep supporting that version of wasmCloud with patches and security updates so, even if we merge breaking changes, we have ongoing fixes in place.
  - Take a look at existing smithy-based components we advise you to start migrating to WASI.

#### Note from Victor on testing

In the future for integration/above-host level tests, we'll have a `wasmcloud-test-util` crate, but right now you can use `wasmcloud/runtime` and `wasmcloud/host` etc.

You can preview this here: <https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/tests/kv-vault.rs>

If you REALLY want to get started quickly, just run `wash up` and `wash app deploy fixture.wadm.yaml`

#### Where we’ll be…

- **February 22** Bailey will be a guest on the [Rancher Live podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPdzvL59tIA) with Divya Mohan. Tune in for a deep dive into WASI 0.2.0!
- **March 14 - 15** We’ll be at [WASM I/O](https://2024.wasmio.tech/) in Barcelona which really is becoming a highlight event. Be sure to say Hi if you’re there and get your tickets early.
- **March 19 - 22** We’ll also be in Paris for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) and [Cloud Native Wasm Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cloud-native-wasm-day/) plus a host of other co-located events. The [schedules](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/schedule/) are live!

#### Listen in…

- Check out the [Arm Developer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTHXGuqXAI) where Bailey and Liam discussed the intersection of Wasm and GPU technologies.
- Cosmonic CTO Bailey Hayes met Chris Matteson (Fermyon) and Oscar Spencer (F5 NGINX) on the panel at the [latest Kubernetes meetup in New York](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-kubernetes-meetup/events/297886914/). They explored the Wasm what’s, why’s, standards and considerations when adoption. [The recording is live!](https://youtu.be/ThcQNR-aVvI)
- Listen in to the last [WasmEdge community meeting](https://youtu.be/ttiE7g2Ojuk) where Bailey Hayes talks all things WASI 0.2.0 and we hear from the students of the University of Tokyo on some cool projects.
