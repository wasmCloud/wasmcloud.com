## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### IMPROMPTU DEMO: Leveraging the JS ecosystem in Wasm components

- Milan Raj from National Instruments gave a demo of example applications using the [Hono web framework](https://hono.dev/) in Wasm, demonstrating how Wasm components can smoothly utilize JS libraries
- You can see Milan's examples on GitHub at https://github.com/rajsite/wasm-component-examples
- You can run the examples in Node or as components
- Advanced Hono functionality is available
- Milan also showed off usage of a plugin for bare-bones OIDC management
- Make sure to check out these excellent examples for yourself!

### DEMO: Component instance saturation metrics

- There are a number of important questions you'll want to be able to answer when running components in production: How do I know how many instances of a component are running at a given time? How do I know what my max is? How do I know if I need to increase the number? 
- Brooks wanted to use our observability implementation to be able to give definitive answers to these sorts of questions.
- Brooks demonstrated using Prometheus to query metrics such as active instances.
- You can also run queries like active instances and max instances as a ratio to represent saturation.
- This can be used in conjunction with alerting, so if (for example) you meet 80-90% saturation, something is triggered.
- Brooks recently made a PR to add `component_active_instances` and `component_max_instances` metrics. You can find the PR here: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/4398

### DISCUSSION: Traits for extending host functionality in embedded cases

- Brooks walked through his recent PR implementing traits for extending host functionality
- Check out the PR on GitHub at https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/4407

### DISCUSSION: Statement on proposed changes to CNCF NATS.io licensing and ownership

- The community discussed recent stories on the licensing and ownership of NATS.
- The wasmCloud project released a [statement](/blog/2025-04-23-statement-on-nats/) last week affirming our commitment to open source and the CNCF
- Brooks shared an architecture diagram outlining the direction for a more fully pluggable wasmCloud
- We plan to include this diagram in documentation soon
- **Note**: On May 1, CNCF and Synadia issued a joint announcement affirming that NATS trademarks will reside with the CNCF and the project licensing will not change. You can see the joint statement [here](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2025/05/01/cncf-and-synadia-align-on-securing-the-future-of-the-nats-io-project/).
