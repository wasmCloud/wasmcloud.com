### Announcement: New CNCF community calendar 

* Liam provided a notice that a new CNCF community calendar is coming soon, which will be used for scheduling meetings&mdash;including wasmCloud community meetings. 
* This will entail a future transition to a new Zoom ID.

### Demo: Sandbox MCP

* Liam demonstrated the [openapi2mcp plugin](https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/openapi2mcp) for [Wasm Shell](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash), which automatically generates MCP tools from an OpenAPI specification, accelerating development of MCP servers in Wasm sandboxes. 
* The demo showed how to pull down templates, generate TypeScript tools, and use `wash dev` to spin up a development server and an MCP inspector to test the interface. 
* Liam also explained how Wasm artifacts generated this way can be pushed to Kubernetes and connected to Claude. 
* He highlighted the importance of understanding agentic specific risks when considering MCP or agentic workflows.

## Community Updates

* Upcoming submission deadlines for [WasmCon at KubeCon EU 2026](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cfp-colocated-events/) (deadline 2 November) and [Wasm.io 2026](https://www.papercall.io/wasmio26) (deadline 24 December).
* Progress on WASI P3 with Victor leading the JCO async support, aiming for a second reference implementation to run specs in a Node.js environment via JCO transpile.
