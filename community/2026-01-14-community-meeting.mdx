## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Demo: "Blobby" enhancements

* Lucas demonstrated a refreshed version of the Blobby example with a new web interface, making it more presentable and user-friendly:  
* The demo now includes a visual UI served by Blobby itself, replacing the need for curl commands
* Users can upload files (single or multiple) through the interface
* Added a copy link feature to easily get URLs for uploaded files
* The UI includes an activity bar showing recent operations
* The demo showcases hosting both UI and API in the same WebAssembly component
* When you run the demo with `wash dev`, data is stored in-memory, while in Kubernetes environments it's backed by NATS Object Store

### Discussion: Changes to `wash build` and `wash dev`

- The team implemented significant architectural changes to how `wash build` and `wash dev` work, moving from implicit to explicit configuration
- Previously, `wash` would infer build methods based on files in the directory (Cargo.toml for Rust, go.mod for Go), which caused problems in monorepos
- The new approach enables developers to specify custom build commands in their configuration
- Developers can now control where the WebAssembly artifact will be located after build
- Different commands can be specified for `wash dev` (debug builds) vs `wash build` (release builds)
- Build commands now support environment variable interpolation and forwarding from the shell environment
- Teams can use makefiles or any other build tool of their choice
- The `-c` flag allows changing to a project directory before `wash` executes
- No longer limited by hardcoded build logic - developers have full control

### Discussion: Service and component development

- The new wash configuration supports developing services (long-running WebAssembly components) alongside stateless components
- Developers can specify additional WebAssembly files to bring into the workload during `wash dev`
- Example shown with cron service and cron component working together
- The workload assembled during development matches the structure that would be deployed to production

### Discussion: Storage and state management discussion

- The team discussed improving local development storage  
- Current in-memory plugins clear data on every code change, requiring re-seeding
- Plan to back in-memory plugins with file system storage in the cache directory
- This will allow developers to seed applications by copying files into a directory and persist data across code changes
- In production, the host plugin approach means platform administrators decide the storage backend (e.g., NATS, S3)
- Each workload gets its own instance of plugins, not a shared monolithic provider
