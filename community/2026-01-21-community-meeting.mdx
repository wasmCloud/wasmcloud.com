- wash rc.6 and update on next items

## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### `wash` rc.6 release

- rc.6 represents one of the largest release candidates to date, with significant changes in both behavior and API
- Changes focused primarily on `wash dev` rather than `wash host`
- Team completed extensive code cleanup including linting and removal of expect/unwraps to prevent panics in critical paths
- Release includes changes to configuration, build environment expectations, and `wash dev` behavior
- New features include:
  * **Persistent Storage**: Blobstore and key-value plugins now backed by filesystem instead of memory
  * Data persists across `wash dev` restarts
  * Users can configure which directory backs blobstore and key-value
  * **Virtual TCP/IP Loopback**: Components can now connect to services over localhost (127.0.0.1)
  * Long-running components can open TCP ports only accessible to other components in the same workload
  * Multiple workloads can open the same port (e.g., port 80) due to interface virtualization
  * **Service/Component Communication**: Improvements in correctness and Wasm context handling

### New QR code generator example

- New example added to demonstrate WebAssembly component development
- Located in `wash` repository under [`examples/qrcode`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/examples/qrcode)
- Demonstrates HTTP request processing, including POST requests
- Generates PNG images server-side (not SVG rendered in browser)
- Showcases components, HTTP handling, static HTML serving, and error handling in just 71 lines of code
- Used as a test case for `wash dev` development cycle

### Next steps to wasmCloud 2.0 release

Team identified three critical items needed before final release:

**1. Internal Kubernetes identifier PR**

- Needs revision and discussion to finalize
- Requires changes in multiple places
- Ensures workloads are never sent to the wrong host

**2. NATS authentication support**

- Currently neither runtime operator nor `wash host` support NATS authentication
- Team needs to investigate whether to support additional authentication methods (tokens, credentials files, etc.)
- Changes must be reflected in Helm chart with security concerns in mind

**3. Outbound transport system for gRPC** 

- Makes HTTP calls gRPC-aware
- Host will automatically detect gRPC environment by checking HTTP headers
- Will make gRPC on top of components essentially transparent
- Currently causes issues with trading headers when using gRPC clients

**Additional validation items**

- Several open items need verification rather than new code
- Focus on confirming expected behavior is correct after recent changes

**Repository structure changes**

- Team plans to move wash repository into main `wasmCloud` repository
- Current `wash` repo will become `wasmcloud-v1`
- Main `wasmcloud` repo will become the primary repository
- Artifacts will be released from the main `wasmcloud` repository
