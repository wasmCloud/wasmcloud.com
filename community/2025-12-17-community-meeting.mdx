## Meeting Notes

### RC5 Release & Documentation Updates 
* The community is currently testing RC5, which includes new features, documentation, and consistency improvements. 
* Eric gave a tour of the updated command reference, reflecting internal consistency changes.
* One major change is how `wash new` works. The templating feature has been removed, and it now clones an example repository directly from a Git URL to serve as a project template. 
* The developer guide has been updated to reflect the new `wash new` process, with a demonstration of creating a Rust project. 
* The Rust hello world example now uses the `wstd` standard library for Wasm components for better ecosystem alignment.

### Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation 
* The Linux Foundation announced the creation of a new Agentic AI Foundation, which will host three new projects: the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard (donated by Anthropic), Goose (a frontend and platform for LLM solutions from Block), and the agents standard.
* Liam emphasezed the relevance to the wasmCloud community, particularly for sandboxing MCP components that address non-deterministic I/O of LLMs and security concerns like prompt injection and remote code execution.

### Community Contributions & Holiday Schedule:
* The next meeting will be January 7.
