## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Documentation of the Week: New wasmCloud website

- Up front, Brooks introduces the updated [wasmcloud.com](https://wasmcloud.com/). Check out the new style, diagrams, graphics, modals, and (much) more!

### Demo: Kubernetes secrets with wasmCloud

- Lucas will show how to use Kubernetes secrets with wasmCloud components and capability providers. 
- You can use Kubernetes as the secrets backend for a given policy, and then a component or provider can use a secret with that policy. 
- The secrets backend is a binary that runs alongside the wasmCloud host. 
- Lucas demonstrates a simple application consuming the secret and then revealing it in the terminal.
- By integrating with Kubernetes secrets, you get access to the entire Kubernetes secrets ecosystem&mdash;you can make use of secrets stored in the AWS secrets manager or wherever else. 
- Jochen: This is awesome for enabling people to use deployed infrastructure that they already have. 
- Brooks: So you deploy this, and you have a one-stop-shop for using secrets with wasmCloud on Kubernetes.
- Joonas: There is a plan to also create a native integration for AWS Secrets Manager down the line, but this is a great way to unlock the use cases we don’t have a “native” backend implementation for today.
- Joonas: For anyone who’s not familiar with External Secrets, [https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/aws-secrets-manager/](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/aws-secrets-manager/) shows a list of the supported backends this integration enables.

### Release cadence

- Going forward, Brooks proposes a faster release cadence for minor releases. 
- As you take a look at wasmCloud 1.1, if you find any issues, let us know in Slack or on GitHub. 

### WASI 0.2.1

- WASI 0.2.1 is coming this week. In wasmCloud, we will get this as an update to wasmtime. 
- Users won't need to update anything on component, provider, or host side.
- The main feature coming in WASI 0.2.1 is feature gates, allowing you to provide features "**since**" a certain version in the WIT.
- This way, you'll know if your runtime supports a new feature before instantiation. 
- Bailey: It will probably be a couple of weeks for wasmtime to update and then for us to consume that within wasmCloud. The other thing to note is that we've added a lot more documentation inside of WASI interfaces themselves. 

## Weekly highlights

### Issue of the Week
