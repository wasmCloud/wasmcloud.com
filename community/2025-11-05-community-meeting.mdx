## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Demo: Next host

- Lucas demonstrated the setup and functionality of wasmCloud v2, highlighting the runtime operator and the new wasmCloud host. 
- By default, wasmCloud v2 utilizes Kubernetes for orchestration.
- NATS serves as the message bus for communication between the runtime operator and the wasmCloud host.
- Workloads can be deployed to specific host groups, allowing for multi-tenant deployments and isolation.
- A new `wash host` command allows the [Wasm Shell binary](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash) to act as a cluster host.
- Responsibility for scheduling has been moved to the operator, allowing for development and use of custom schedulers.
- The runtime allows for custom host plugins to extend functionality.
- wasmCloud v2.0.0-rc1 will be released in the next days, and we'd love feedback!

Discussions and Q&A:

- **Autoscaling for Hosts**: Discussed how autoscaling can be achieved at the Kubernetes layer using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) for hosts, but not yet for components themselves.
- **Workload and Service Concepts**: Services allow for long-running code and act as a supervisor for components within that workload. This enables features like connection pooling and managing long-lived resources.
- **Host Plugins as Providers**: Discussion on whether host plugins should support both in-process and out-of-process communications, with the current implementation focusing on local calls within the host.
- **Multicluster Considerations**: The approach for multicluster environments aligns with Kubernetes' capabilities, emphasizing management within Kubernetes boundaries.
Community Updates and Events:

Async support in JCO for Preview 3 of the component model.

### Discussion: WASI P3 update

- Victor provided an update on how async support is proceeding in jco's WASI P3 implementation, which will provide a second reference implementation for WASI P3. 

## Weekly highlights

### Documentation of the Week

- The Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) used by the release candidate for wasmCloud v2 are [documented in the v2.0.0-rc1 version of the docs](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/v2.0.0-rc.1/kubernetes-operator/crds/). 

## Community Updates

- WasmCon NA in Atlanta: Flynn and Bailey will be giving a talk demonstrating wasmCloud with Linkerd.
- A [new blog post](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2025-11-05-introducing-the-next-generation-wasmcloud-runtime/) detailing the architecture of wasmCloud v2 has been published.
- Upcoming CFPs: Calls for papers are open for Wasm.io.
- KubeCon: [Check out the blog](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmcloud-at-kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2025/) for details about wasmCloud's presence at KubeCon, including booth location and various talks.
