2. Pull request review
3. New Docs


## Meeting Notes

### Forthcoming `wash` v2 release

* Lucas outlined the remaining tasks to cut the `wash` v2 release, which mainly involve closing existing issues and pull requests, many of which are already fixed but require validation.
* Several features were discussed as likely not making it into the initial `wash` v2 major release but potentially being included in subsequent point releases:
  - Integration tests for existing features, as they don't add new functionality and require further code changes due to recent fixture handling updates.
  - Component restarts, a feature that allows reloading a single component within a workload, is primarily useful for local development (wash dev) and embedders, but its applicability in clustered environments is still under discussion due to potential conflicts with orchestrator behavior.
  - The virtual TCP UDP loopback feature is being deferred to align with the release of wasmtime 41, avoiding the need for a temporary wasmtime fork.
* Key additions targeted for release candidate 6 (rc6) include:
  - "Multi-Wasm" support for developing services and components side-by-side.
  - Net authentication for enhanced security of the host and operator.
  - Workload ID from Kubernetes for improved resiliency.
  - The inclusion of blobstore and key-value interfaces in `wash dev`, initially as in-memory interfaces, with plans for filesystem backing in the future.
  - The publication of a WIT package for `wash` alongside the release.

### Community discussions
* The potential inclusion of a gRPC addition as a default behavior in `wash` v2, aiming for simplification and readiness for shipment.
* Massoud shared his project for a WIT translator from P2 to P3 using LLMs and discussed its potential utility for the Bytecode Alliance and the broader WebAssembly ecosystem.
* The timeline for consolidating the `wash` runtime crate into the wasmCloud repository, addressing challenges related to artifact naming and potentially separating the host into its own binary.
