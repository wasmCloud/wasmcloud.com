## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### v2 releases

- v2.0.0-rc.6 was released last week
- v2.0.0-rc.7 is in development with focus on observability and code base stabilization, not adding new features
- The team is addressing leftover issues and closing open threads from previous releases

### DEMO: wasmCloud v2 host OTEL

- Lucas presented a comprehensive demonstration of the new OpenTelemetry (OTEL) observability features coming in rc.7
- Demo used Aspire Dashboard as the OTEL receiver to visualize logs, traces, and metrics
- Demonstrated both `wash dev` (local development) and Kubernetes environments
- Showed complete request lifecycle tracing from HTTP requests through WebAssembly component execution and back
- Traces show every step in the execution pipeline, including component builds, loading, plugin binding, and linking
- Component parsing time is visible, with most time in local dev spent on parsing
- In Kubernetes environments, OCI image pulling dominates the startup time (1.8 seconds in demo)
- Traces maintain context across the Rust/WebAssembly boundary, tracking calls from components into plugins like blobstore
- Rich contextual information is captured including workload IDs, namespaces, container names, and request paths
- Plugin authors don't need to add instrumentation code - it's handled automatically by the engine
- Any component using WASI APIs supported by the host gets auto-instrumentation
- Works identically in local development and production Kubernetes environments
- Logs link to their associated traces for drill-down analysis

## Community Updates
