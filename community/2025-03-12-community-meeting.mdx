## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: wadm config deployment improvements

- We recently fixed a bug with wadm config deployment which will result in improved reconciliation times for local deployments. 
- We can do config on components or providers using wasi runtime config. Previously, when we deployed example applications using runtime config locally, we would wait for a moment for the wasm component to reconcile. This was strange, since components are small and there was no clear reason why it should take this amount of time to start. 
- The source was a small bug in reconciliation logic for wadm&mdash;now fixed.
- Tl;dr this patch bump should result in much quicker reconciliation for wadm locally â€” deployments should go from 15s to less than 1s. 

### DISCUSSION: wash-cli and wash-lib are dead ... Long live wash

- The `wash-cli` and `wasi-lib` crate merge is now complete.
- With the completion of the merge, the feature freeze on wash is now over.
- If you previously used `cargo` to install `wash-cli`, you'll now want to use the `wash` crate instead.

### DISCUSSION: Countdown to KubeCon EU

- Search for wasm in the KubeCon schedule&mdash;there are a number of wasmCloud events, and we hope to see you there!
