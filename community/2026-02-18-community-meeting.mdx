## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Demo and Discussion: wasmCloud v2 templates and TCP socket support

- Lucas presented new templates and examples for wasmCloud v2 that focus on full application development rather than single components. The templates now support `cargo` workspaces with multiple components, making it easier to structure larger projects. 
- Demonstrated TCP socket binding capabilities in wasmCloud v2, which provides localhost isolation per workload. Each workload has its own localhost, allowing multiple workloads to bind to the same port without conflicts. The demo showed an HTTP component communicating with a long-running TCP service component within the same workload.  
  * Components can be stateless while communicating with long-running connection pools
  * `cargo` workspaces can contain multiple components and regular Rust code
  * `wash` configuration specifies which components to load from the workspace
  * Future use cases include bringing custom connection bouncers or database proxies compiled to Wasm

### Discussion: Excalidraw diagram tooling PR

- Eric presented a PR adding Excalidraw diagram tooling to the docs repo to help generate architecture diagrams programmatically while maintaining project brand identity.   The PR includes:
  * A Claude skill for Excalidraw diagrams in the .claude directory
  * Custom scripts to export Excalidraw files to crisp PNG files
  * Documentation for diagram workflow, brand colors, and instructions for creating and editing diagrams
  * [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) file to help Claude Code generate appropriate diagrams
- Bailey shared an Excalidraw library with wasmCloud logos and branding elements that can be easily added by clicking a link.   The library includes a legend feature and makes it easy to apply wasmCloud color schemes to diagrams.

### Discussion: WASI P3 update

- Bailey provided an update on WASI P3 work. A new release candidate was cut and rolled into wasmtime, but significant changes to wasi:cli based on implementation feedback required additional changes in wasm-tools. The changes involved modifications to stdout, stderr, and error message handling using features, which uncovered several bugs that have now been fixed.  
- New versions of everything except wasmtime have been cut, and the changes will land in the next wasmtime release. Victor completed a major PR for streams support in the reference implementation. The team is not currently aware of any more changes needed to the WASI APIs, making the current release candidate close to stable.

## Community Updates

### Bytecode Alliance Plumber Summit

- Bailey announced the Bytecode Alliance Plumber Summit happening next week on Wednesday and Thursday, with three-hour sessions each day.  The summit will conflict with the regular wasmCloud Wednesday community meeting, so Liam will handle MC duties while encouraging others to attend the summit.  

Day 1 agenda highlights:

- Luke Wagner keynote on the road to 1.0
- Cooperative threads update
- Guest languages session covering componentized Python, Go, and other languages with Joel Dice
- Victor Adossi presenting on JCO work and browser support for the component model

Day 2 agenda highlights:

- wasmtime-focused sessions on compile time, built-ins, guest debugging, and OOM handling
- Lightning talks on component virtualization, fuzzing, and WASI specification tooling
