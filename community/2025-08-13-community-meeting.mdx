## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

## DEMO / DISCUSSION: Event sourcing + Wasm

* Yordis discussed an experimental project that uses WebAssembly components for event sourcing, explaining...
  - The core concepts of event sourcing, such as command handlers that process commands and return events, and event handlers that react to events.
  - The role of the event sourcer component and persistent storage layer in handling the flow and storage of commands and events.
  - How Wasm resources are used efficiently to pass around opaque handles of events and commands, allowing the system to work with bytes without knowing the internal structure.
* Yordis discussed his journey into using WebAssembly for event sourcing, driven by the desire for deterministic code and control over side effects.
