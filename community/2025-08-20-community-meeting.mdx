## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Blog: Good First Issues 

* Eric published a [blog post outlining "good first issues"](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2025-08-15-good-first-issues-q3-2025/) from the wasmCloud roadmap, making it easier for new contributors to find entry points into the project.

### `wash` 1.0 Beta Release 

* A significant area for contributions is the new wasmCloud `wash` project, a greenfield evolution called "Wasm Shell." It's written in Rust but supports plugins in both Rust and Go, since plugins are implemented as Wasm components.
* The new version of wash is being released under a 1.0 beta tag, intended to eventually replace the old version once it covers key workflows and its plugin model is sufficient.

### Community Contributions

* A shout-out was given to Carlos for quickly taking on good first issues in the `wash` repository. Brooks encourages others to leave comments on issues if they intend to work on them to avoid duplicate efforts.

### Setup Wash Action for GitHub Actions

* Bailey has been working on the [setup-wash action for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/wasmCloud/setup-wash-action), which helps users easily set up wash in their CI/CD pipelines. This action is being pushed to the GitHub Actions marketplace.

### wasmCloud 1.9 Minor Release 

* The wasmCloud project itself received a new minor release (version 1.9). Notable contributions include Jacob's work on getting wash to work with the XTG base directory specification, a dashboard option for `wash dev`, and Massoud's HTTP client built-in provider. Brooks also acknowledged all first-time contributors in this release.
