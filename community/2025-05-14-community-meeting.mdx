## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Discussion: "Docs page of the week" and "Issue of the week"

- Brooks revived the “Documentation of the Week” segment, highlighting a recent docs addition on experimental support for [error handling with custom interfaces and wRPC](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/developer/interfaces/error-handling/).

- This led naturally to a new “Issue of the Week” — the error handling documentation mentioned above uses an example from the wRPC repo, but [we could really use a wasmCloud-specific example](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/issues/922). 

### Discussion and showcase: TypeScript examples, axios library, and Node ecosystem

- Victor shared progress in the Node ecosystem, showcasing how the popular [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) HTTP request library works with WebAssembly components.
