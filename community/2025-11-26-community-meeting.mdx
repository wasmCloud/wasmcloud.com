## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Discussion: wasmCloud V2 docs update 

* Bailey highlighted new overview sections in the wasmCloud v2 documentation, which include details on new types, plugin functionality, interfaces, transports, and OCI packages. 
* A significant addition is the migration guide from V1 to V2, addressing a common community request. 

### Demo: C++ Style Bindings for wit-http

* Bailey also showcased a new example for building with wit-http using modern C++ style bindings. The demo illustrates how to create ergonomic and clean C++ code for handling HTTP requests and responses, resulting in tiny WebAssembly binaries (e.g., 67 kilobytes). 
* This feature is available starting with wit-bindgen 48.1. 

### Demo and Discussion: gRPC and Protobuf Integration 

* Next Bailey discussed the integration of gRPC and protobuf within wasmCloud. 
* Protobuf handles serialization and deserialization of types, while gRPC is a networking protocol. 
* The demo shows protobuf working for serialization and deserialization, and Bailey notes that wit-http is designed to be protocol agnostic, allowing gRPC to be handled by passing appropriate headers to the HTTP server implementation.

### Discussion: Workload Identities in wasmCloud V2

* Finally Bailey discussed how workload identities are handled in wasmCloud v2, particularly in relation to Kubernetes environments. 
* In wasmCloud v2, workload identity is considered an external feature, handled by the service mesh, and is agnostic from wasmCloud's perspective. It is integrated into the scheduling operation, meaning a workload carries its namespace and a unique workload ID, preventing identity takeover issues present in v1. 
* This allows for ACLs at the scheduling layer, enabling granular control over component communication.
