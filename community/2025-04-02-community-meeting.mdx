## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Live From KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, 2025

- We joined the community live from the wasmCloud booth in the CNCF Project Pavilion, where we were joined by the ever-growing roster of maintainers and project owners. As always it was great to connect with many of you in-person during our annual trip to Europe.
- The recordings from the event will go live in the coming days but, in the meantime, whet your appetite with our summary blog.
- Recommended: SPIFFE Workload Identity for wasmCloud workloads; Joonas and Colin's talk was a highlight - watch this space for the recording.
- Brooks showed the demo that we shared at the show - as always check out the recording for the demo.
- Demo shows what it's like to build an application with wasmCloud. A really clear view of what wasmCloud feels like in practice.
- We use the example of WasmPay - an international, cross-border payment platform working with WebAssembly, based on a validation model.
- Check out the recording to see how this platform negotiates payment validation across languages, banks, geographies, and in a wide variety of currencies.
- There are some interesting metrics coming from this early demo which we will dig into at a later date.
- We will do a more in-depth demo of WasmPay, perhaps in next week's community call.

## Community Updates
