### Agenda

- 
- DISCUSSION: Long-running wasmCloud processes
  - Pre-discussion note: wasmCloud processes are limited by executing for 2 seconds by default, overridable by the `WASMCLOUD_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` variable.
  - Good pre-reading: [Dealing with the Diabolical Distributed Deadline Dilemma](https://kevinhoffman.blog/post/distributed_deadlines/)
- DISCUSSION: [Metrics RFC](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/664)
