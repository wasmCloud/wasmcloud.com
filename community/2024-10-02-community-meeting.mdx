## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: Go component testing & IDE debugging 

- As always, it's difficult to express the glory of Brook's demo in notes. Please check out the recording below.
- We've updated the Go developer experience in our documentation and now have language-specific guidance for testing. We started with Go but more to come.
- Our new [Developer Guide](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/category/developer-guide) now has a [Go-specific](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/developer/languages/go/components) testing guide (under Languages), and we'll continue to build out our language-specific resources in the coming months.
- The guide details everything you need to do to get started. It starts with new Go component code which can be used alongside the wit-bindgen and WAdge toolset (preliminary information there right now, but we will expand in the coming weeks).
- Brooks shows off some of the new tooling coming down the line in wash. E.g. Init function and implementation of a wasi-http transport for Go's http library.
- It's worth reminding ourselves that wash dev is a powerful addtion to the toolbox. wash dev is a muti-facted feature that allows us to build, review our dependencies and create the declaritive manifest.
- Thank you to everyone who has worked hard to get this working. In particular, everyone on the Tinygo side pushing WASI P2 as a target, our internal maintainers and community contributors.
- Maahir: what about Wasm adoption and big code spaces? Is it being adopted by giants or just in testing phase?
- Brooks mentions the upcoming [WasmCon conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/schedule/) that features many wasmCloud adopters. We also have several user stories published on the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/08/23/wasmcloud-on-the-factory-floor-efficient-and-secure-processing-of-high-velocity-machine-data/) and [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/tm-forum-webassembly-canvas-project-in-phase-2) blogs.

### DEMO: wasmCloud LLaVA App (LLM + Vision)

- Again, this is such a rich demo, we suggest you catch the recording below.
- This demo shows the flexibility of the environment we built for our space demo (see [Bailey's Innovation Day keynote](https://youtu.be/vEHbZCBmPok)), now congfigured for different, more security-centric use case; this time finance. 
- We have developed a banking app to demonstrate how Wasm can work in a high-security identification scenario. In the same way the space demo identified boats, we can change the prompt for a different use case.
- Lachlan shows how we've repurposed the environment to look for ID documentation. Swift configuration - exactly the same front end, with just a simple prompt changed.

### DEMO: Update on `wkg` tooling

- We've been working on OCI tooling, and some specific tooling for the wider Wasm community we call Wasm Package Tooling - or `wkg` for short.
- This is a way to manage all the dependencies and create a smart packaging methodology for the WebAssedmbly ecosystem.
- `wkg` CLI - all the developer tools you need, wrapped up in a neat package (pardon the pun).
- Check out the Bytecode Alliance repo for [updates on this project](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools).
- Taylor's demo shows the integration with the `wkg` tool with wash - check out the recording below for the demo and much wider discussion.
- There is still some work to do on the PR but stay tuned and we'll update the community soon.

### DISCUSSION: [wasmCloud Q4 2024 Roadmap](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3119)

- Next week (9th Oct) we will have a special community board to plan our Q4 activities. A great opp to look at where we can make the most impact for our users and community.
- Check in on our [Github disussion](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3119) to suggest features, prioritize fixes, and to brainstorm priorities for the next phase of development. 
- Our previous roadmap focused on community contributions, improving developer workflows, and finalizing some support for WASI interfaces. Based on the discussion next week, we'll determine our next roadmap's focus.
- Please feel free to comment whether you're a long-time wasmCloud user, maintainer, first-time contributor, or just curious onlooker that noticed something we should do.

### Community highlights

- [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is here! We've [tagged a ton of issues](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open+label:hacktoberfest) in the wasmCloud repo so you can add your wasmCloud contributions to your Hacktoberfest activities. Take a look and get started!

### Tune in…

- [WasmCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/) is coming and we're excited to see so many talks that have a wasmCloud flavour. The agenda is live and registrations are open. Take a look, we're looking forward to seeing everyone in Salt Lake City.

{/* Add any upcoming events/streams/etc */}

### Catch up…

- Bailey joined the Google Chrome Devs' [WasmAssembly podcast](https://wasmassembly.libsyn.com/exploring-the-bytecode-alliance-with-cosmonics-hailey-bayes-wasmassembly), hosted by Thomas Steiner PhD. In this episode, Bailey discusses WebAssembly in the Bytecode Alliance and at Cosmonic. Tune in for a deep dive on the future of Wasm and the role of the BA.
