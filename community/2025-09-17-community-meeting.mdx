## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DISCUSSIONS: wasmCloud crate consolidation and wasmCloud next

- Brooks presented plans for the radical simplification of APIs and architecture, and a consolidation of crates in support of that goal. He covered [his PR](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/pull/73) introducing the new `wasmcloud` crate.
- The `wasmcloud` crate consolidates host, runtime, and core libraries into a single crate
- The new crate aims to...
   * Introduce a simplified Host API focused on scheduling "workloads" (collections of components with configuration)
   * Replace built-in capability providers with host plugins for easier extension
   * Make the wRPC layer optional and plugin-based
   * Support in-process component-to-component calls for components running on the same host
- Benefits and improvements from the new approach include...
  * Simpler API surface for deploying and managing components
  * No requirement to run NATS for local development
  * Host plugins enable extending wasmCloud without modifying core code
  * Performance improvements through direct component-to-component calls
  * Better separation of concerns: wasmCloud focuses on being the best WebAssembly application runtime
  * Still maintains OCI-based component distribution

### DISCUSSION: `next` version in docs

- Eric has a [PR up](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/pull/987) creating a "next" version of docs along with initial documentation for Wasm Shell, the next generation of `wash`
- Documentation will be iteratively updated to reflect the new architecture
- New system context and application service diagrams created to explain the architecture
- Community Excalidraw library being used and expanded for architecture diagrams
