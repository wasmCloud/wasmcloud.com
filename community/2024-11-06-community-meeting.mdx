## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: `wash dev` interface overrides

- As always, it's difficult to cover the beauty of this demo and so please check out the recording below!
- [wash dev](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/2508) is a CLI tool that brings the hot reload experience developers expect to WebAssembly. Practitioners build with applications with components in exactly the same way they would usually build applications.
- Brooks shows some cool new improvements to `wash dev` which mean we can override interfaces.
- He shows an iniitially cloned TinyGo 'hello world' template - [accessible](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) through the Quickstart.
- The component logic is an http handler which parses the query perameter for naming out of the URL using the Go request type. 
- We will use the generated wasi key-value bindings to open a key-value store - and we can see our key-value counter demo.
- We're moving towards a world where we can be selective about the interfaces we use, and make them fully configurable for individual needs.
- Check out the demo in action in the recording below and the wider discussion that ensued.
- Kudos to Massoud and Victor for the collaboration and deployment.

### DISCUSSION: Windows as a development target for wasmCloud

- Community Slack - bug reported - there have been a few comments around the Windows developer experience as a dev target for wasmCloud.
- In our docs you'll find several tabs that allow you to set up based on what you're using. Toolchains and capability providers etc.
- We also run our unit testing on the Windows target.
- We have tried dilgently to keep Windows as OSS maintained. We have done an OK job but there are some concerns.
- For instance: use of chocolatey to run `wash`.
- Very few of our maintainers are running on Windows, so we're not exercising these flows in a local environment.
- Seeking community feedback on Windows as a dev env. We are keen to support Windows in a better way and so we're looking for feedback on moving Windows to a tier 2 target for developments in the wasmCloud environment.

- Massoud and Aditya: Depends on how many in the community are using the platform - has to be justified based on need.
- Bailey: Suggest we document how to use WSL - in theory we don't have to do much more but there is definitey a path to success. Potentially deprecate our scoop and chocolatey. Set Windows support to community maintained - with WSL recommended for running on Windows.

### DISCUSSION: [WasmCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/schedule/) and [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/): the rundown

- Check out this [handy blog](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-10-30-wasmcloud-at-kubecon-na-2024) which covers where we'll be, when we and our users and community members will be on stage, and which workshops we're running.
- Check out the recording for Brook's full run down of what to expect, what to see, and our predicted highlights! We would love to see you - we'll be manning the wasmCloud booth 2B in the Project Pavilion Wednesday afternoon and evening (for KubeCrawl).
- We are particularly excited to have so many user presentations at WasmCon! Including American Express, Adobe and Akamai!
- We also have a couple of grab-bag workshops where you can get hands on with Wasm.
- We'll also be manning the Cosmonic booth *T35* in the Solutions Showcase so don't forget to pop by, say hi, and grab some swag!

### DISCUSSION: [Contribfest!](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/overview/type/%F0%9F%9A%A8+Contribfest) What, where, and how to participate

- [Contribfest](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/overview/type/%F0%9F%9A%A8+Contribfest?iframe=no) sessions are available to all KubeCon attendees and are 90-minute in-person sessions designed to provide projects with the space and resources to tackle outstanding technical debt, security issues, or outstanding impactful feature requests. It is intended to provide a place for maintainers to meet contributors and potential contributors and work together on solving a problem.
- We are delighted to have been selected this year - a major deal for us as maintainers and we'd love to see you there!
- This is such an important moment to get in a room with maintainers, contributors and users to build Wasm components and contribute them to the wider WebAssembly ecosystem. And those who want to contribute to our Rust and Go projects in wasmCloud ecosystem.
- This is a great opportunity for us to work with our community to reduce the technical debt and forge a way forward. Come join us, write some code and have some fun! See you there!

See you all in Salt Lake City!
