### DEMO: `wasmcloud:postgres/transaction` support

- With a bit of group SQL collaboration, Brooks demonstrates transactions with the Postgres provider

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud monorepo, thoughts and opinions

- To set the stage, Brooks notes that we're using a monorepo for all but a few repos, which are generally language-specific (e.g. [wasmcloud/go](https://github.com/wasmcloud/go), [wasmcloud/typescript](https://github.com/wasmcloud/typescript)) because those tend to have language-specific expectations.
- The monorepo generally operates on Rust conventions.
- Do we want to continue using a monorepo? The primary arguments against are that it makes CI complicated and (partly as a result) makes the repo unwieldy to work with for potential contributors
- Yordis notes you need a standardized process of using techniques like sparse checkouts to make a monorepo less unwieldy
- Taylor proposes getting rid of Nix one way or another, and suggests that it will be an equal amount of work to move away from a monorepo or make the necessary investments in doing a monorepo properly
- Brooks: We should probably 1) explore replacing Nix actions with GitHub actions and 2) create a dependency graph for crates to help make decisions
- Let us know in [Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/) if you have any thoughts on this, and we expect to discuss further next meeting!
