## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DISCUSSION: In-process component to component calls

- Brooks explains a new feature that allows two components running on the same host to communicate directly, rather than sending invocations over wRPC/NATS. 
- This significantly reduces latency from hundreds of microseconds to single-digit nanoseconds. 
- The goal is to support this direct communication for components on the same host, while still allowing distributed communication via wRPC or other interfaces.

### DISCUSSION: Reduce host responsibility and API surface

- Brooks discusses the evolution of the wasmCloud runtime crate, detailing efforts to extract parts of the runtime into a new, more modular crate called `runtime` within the [`wash` repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/crates/wash/src/runtime). 
- This aims to simplify the host's responsibility, making it primarily focused on component lifecycle management (starting, linking, stopping). 
- It also introduces a "plugin" system for built-in capabilities (like HTTP server or logging) to be optionally added, rather than being hardwired into the runtime.

### DEMO: `wash` CLI completions

- Bailey demonstrates new auto-completion features in the `wash` command-line interface (CLI). 
- This improves the developer experience by providing command and argument suggestions as the user types.
