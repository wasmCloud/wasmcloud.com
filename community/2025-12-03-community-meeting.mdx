### DEMO AND DISCUSSION: Services update

* Lucas discussed and demonstrated the wasmCloud v2 concept of "services."
* In wasmCloud V2, workloads are composed of many components, which are stateless and invocation-based. Services, however, are stateful, and can act like localhost for your components.
* Services can open TCP sockets, enabling them to manage persistent connections, provide connection pooling, proxying, and more. Components within a workload can connect to these services via localhost.
* Services are useful for things like managing database connections (e.g., running a PG bouncer), handling large amounts of memory, or maintaining state across multiple invocations.
* Maintainers are actively working on services, including development with `wash`.
